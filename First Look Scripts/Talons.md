## A Star Citizen's First Look

### Preface
I'm going to give you a First Look of the Esperia Talon & Talon Shrike, and where starting right now.

### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to A Star Citizen's "First Look" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and In this first look, you'll get to see my live first impressions of the New Esperia Talon & Talon Shrike. We'll be taking a tour of the thier exterior, interior, check their stock weapons, and take them for a brief test flight. This was recorded live in the 3.12 PTU over on Twitch. Be sure to head over there as I'm probably still live, testing loadouts. Enough with the formalities, Let's take a first look at the Esperia Talon.

### Outro
What do you guys think of this first look at the Talons. Do you agree with my first thoughts. Which one if any will you be picking up? Let me know in the comments. If you enjoy my channel there are so many ways to support it, I go live on Twitch just before almost every video release, and id love to see you there. There are also other free options like prime gaming subscriptions and sending aUEC in the verse, because, reviewing ships is expensive. There are also SubClub Subscriptions, Merch, and more generous forms of support. Head over to subliminalschannel.tv to learn how. Your support in all forms makes this channel possible even your viewership, liking, and subscribing goes a long way. To continue watching here is a video I think you may like, here is a video Youtube thinks you may like & Until next time Citizens, I'll see you in the verse.
