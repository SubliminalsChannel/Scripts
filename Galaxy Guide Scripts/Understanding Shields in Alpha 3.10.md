Lets get straight into those tabs on erkul and what they mean. We'll start from left to right. The first is Health. Health is best described as a pool. Each shield generator indevidually ads to the shields pool. Once this pool is depleated your ships hull will take 100% of damage that comes through the downed facing. If you didnt know this is a facing.
#### Regen Rate
Next is Regen Rate. Regen rate is the maximum ammount of healh your shield generator can add to the health pool per second if your shield gets downed or damaged. Simple right?, nope Regen Rate is not the only thing that determins the rate that your shield will regenerate, request time has an equal or greater effect but we'll get to that in a bit.
#### Damaged Regen Delay
Now your Regen Rate can be interrupted by your Damage Regen Dealy
