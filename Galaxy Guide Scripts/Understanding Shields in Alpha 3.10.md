# Understanding Shields in Alpha 3.11
## A Star Citizen's Guide to the Galaxy

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know about shields in Alpha 3.11 and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Guide to the Galaxy" this is SubliminaL here and today  We're going to take a deep dive into shield generators. We'll discuss and demonstraight everything from, how power plants and coolers effect shields, How overclocking changes shields, as well as what every one of these tabs on erkul mean, and how it effects your shields. Plus we'll answer some questions and bust myths that some of our viewers on Twitch had. I may be completely wrong about some of the info in this guide and that's OK because we are all learning throughout our journey in Star Citizens Alpha that is constantly changing. The pinned comment will be used to ensure accuracy. This is Part 4 of a series that will cover each archetype of component and weapon in depth. So Make sure your subscribed and have the bell clicked for more. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Erkul Tabs
Lets get straight into those tabs on erkul and what they mean. For our Example we'll be using the FR-66, and work our way from left to right.
#### Health Pool
The first is Health. Health is best described as a health pool. Each shield generator indevidually adds health to the shields pool. In the example of the FR-66 this value is 6120. I am unsure if this value is split amongst all four shield facings or if this is the value for each facing. And to be honest for comparison it doesnt really matter. As you can see your shield facings health pools are displayed in this diagram surronding your ship. As you take damage the pool depletes.Once this pool is depleated your ships hull will take 100% of damage that comes through the downed facing.
#### Regen Rate
Next is Regen Rate. Regen rate is the maximum ammount of healh your shield generator can add to the health pool per second, if your shield gets downed or damaged. It is displayed along with your health pool here, if you avoid damage for enough time your shields will start to regen. Simple right?, nope Regen Rate is not the only thing that determins the rate that your shield will regenerate, request time has an equal or greater effect but we'll get to that in a bit.
#### Damaged Regen Delay
Now for Damaged Regen Delay, this is the ammount of time in seconds that the regen process will be halted if a shield facing takes damage before it can fully recharge. For example as you can see here I am taking damage, but not enough to down the facing. As you can see the FR-66s start to regen after almost 4 seconds.
#### Downed Regen Delay
Downed Regen delay is exactly the same as Damaged except of course it only applies if your shield facing gets downed completely. This is typlically a much longer duration than the damaged delay. By design this punishes players for allowing a shield facing to get completely downed. As you can see here with my shield facing down the FR-66 takes just 5 and a half seconds to start to regen after being downed completely.
#### Physical Absorbtion minimum & maximum
Now for one of my favorite shield properties, physical Absorbtion minimum and maximum. This is the minimum or maximum ammount of physical damage or (Ballistic fire) that a shield can deflect. This means that regardless of shield health
