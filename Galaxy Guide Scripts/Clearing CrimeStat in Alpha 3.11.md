# Clearing Your CrimeStat in Alpha 3.11
## A Star Citizen's Guide to the Galaxy

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know to clear your CrimeSat and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Guide to the Galaxy" this is SubliminaL here and today we'll be discussing the many differnt ways you can clear your CrimeStat and stay out of troube in alpha 3.11. Recently ive found myself on the other side of the law more often than id like. Either while trying to get the 50 PVP kills required to get the Vanduul Mask or from a bug like the UEE randomly attacking me during CS Bounty Hunting missions for no reason. Ive always played Star Citizen as a good player fighting the bad guys, and to be honest thats getting old. So today ill show you everything ive learned from where to buy CryptoKeys to comm array hacking to completly removing your crimestat from the UEE recprds. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### CrimeStat System
There are many ways to get a CrimeStat in Star Citizen. While naming them all is beyond the scope of this guide, there is attacking other players, trading Comtrolled substances, pad ramming, homicide, and not stopping to be searched by the UEE. And then there are a slew of bugs that can surround these mechanics that could put you on the wromg side of the law unjustly. Your crimestat can range from 0 to 5 with 5 being the worst. It is displayed by this avatar surrounded by a circle thats disected into 5ths. Level 1 and 2 crimestats have minimal reprocussions you can be attacked onsight by the UEE or any players nearby and landing safely at any spaceports other than grimhex or levski will be a problem. At this stage dieing would only land you a small stent at klescher. Level 3 is the first level that will alert player bounty hunters with a mission to take you out. This is where things get dagerous. The value on your head contines to rise as your CrimeStat Increases. And at the final stage Level 5, not only would another player be awarded 20,000aUEC for killing you, but you'll have to do it with the full force of the UEE on your back. And they'll be sporting the likes of  vanguards and even a hammerhead. And if they kill you you'll be looking at a 12 hour sentence at everyones favorite rehabilitation center.

### Purchasing a CryptoKey
The first step to either hacking a comm array or hacking your crimestat away is to purchase a CryptoKey. These can be purchaded from a multitude of  locations. Personally I prefer Technotic at GrimHex because all but 1 Card can be purchased there either that or The Factory Line at New Babbage because the best CryptoKey can be found there. To find Technotic head over to GrimHex. Once here head toward the elevator and take it dowm to.the concourse. Once down here make a left and follow dowm the corridor and enter this room. This is Technotic. All but the IcePick can be purchased here. As for The Factory Line, head to New Babbage on MicroTech. Once you exit your ship take the elevator from your hangar up to the NBIS TERMINALS. Head left and dowm this hall toward the tram system, keep following this path until you reach this fork. We want to go to the Commoms, take the tram to the commoms. once you arrive, head up the stairs and up the stairs again. go toward the New Babbage Plaza and keep straight. head down this beautiful flight of stairs until you get to the LEVEL. The most expensive Cryptokey the IcePick can be found here. CryptoKeys range in price from 199aUEC for the Walesko to the 1600aUEC IcePick we just bought from NB. Choosing what Cryptokey to purchase depends on the situation. Are you working with a low budget? How high is your Crimestat? What is at risk if you die or go to prison right now? Personally I keep 5 Walesko's  5 Rippers and 5 IcePicks on me at all times. So what are the differences between these keys you ask? Well Keys can fail, while hacking you may need to hit a CONTINUE BUTTON that would distract you from people or NPCs that may be trying to kill you, and the hacking process can take some time. The less expensive keys will be more prone to fail, need constant interaction and  take more time to hack. And more expensive keys can be pluged in left alone and hack much faster.
