## A Star Citizen's Guide to the Galaxy

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know to clear and keep from getting a CrimeStat and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Guide to the Galaxy" this is SubliminaL here and today I have something different for you because I'm kind of tired of reviewing ships to be honest. Recently I've found myself on the other side of the law more often than id like. Either while trying to get the 50 PVP kills required to get the Vanduul Mask or from a bug like the UEE randomly attacking me during CS Bounty Hunting missions for no reason. I've always played Star Citizen as a good player fighting the bad guys but, that's getting old and the naughty missions are something I've really been wanting to get into. And although I have been playing Star Citizen for a while the process is certainly become more fleshed out as of late. So today ill show you everything I've learned from where to buy CryptoKeys to comm array hacking to completely removing your CrimeStat from the UEE records.
