### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to "A Star Citizenâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy" this is SubliminaL here and today Im going to share with you some tips I wish I had known when I took my fist steps in the verse. Star Citizen is a complicated game and it can be daunting at the start. Since the game can't hold your hands due to obvious reasons, I will.
This is part of a series on the channel with 10 tips that will follow some sort of theme. The theme for this guide will from the bed to the skies.
Giving you some quick tips to make it easier to get from the bed you spawn in to landing at a space station. If you are a veteran player stick around becuase you may learn somthing, a couple of these ive actually learned from my twitch chat within the last few months. Also make sure to list any tips you may have for future episodes in this series. 

### Borderless Windowed

As I stated in the Intro Star Citizen is a space sim and it can be pretty hard at times to figure things out so surfice to say you will be spending alot of time googling and searching for answers to questions. So my first tip before we get into the verse, is to step you through how to setup Borderless Windowed Mode. First, click escape on your keyboard and then settings. Go to the Graphics tab and find and turn on fullscreen. Now find borderless Window and enable it. Now with this enabled you can alt tab without the game being automatically minimized. This can help trmendously if your trying to brouse the internet or chat on discord while still looking at the screen. Ok now lets hop into the verse. CLICK STANTON

### F12 to Remove Chat


### Binding F to Mouse

Ok so you've spawmed in and are lying in the bed of your hab. Tap Y to leave your bed. Remember this as you will be using it to leave any seat or bed you sit in in the verse. Let me be the first to Welcome you to Star Citizen this is you HAB. Well its not yours because after we leave here the door will close and you'll be unable to enter again. You can interact with things in the verse by pressing and holdimg the F key on your keyboard. My next tip is to actually map your F key to a button on your mouse becuase you will be usimg this a lot. If you have a mouse with a clutch button like on some popular FPS mice this would be ideal however programming this to any button easily accessable to your thumb is very immersive. When you reach out to touch items its like your grabbing them. TO DO THIS ON CORSAIRS ICUE SOFTWARE SIMPLY... AND ON RAYZER SYNAPSE... 

### Double Tapping F to Interact



### Binding Helmet on/off toggle to H

This next tip is going to involve adding a keybinding. Soon you may find yourself needing to easily remove and put on your helmet, either for emmersion or simply eating or drinking. Currently there is no keybinding for this so lets add one. SHOW HOW TO ADD KEYBIND.
