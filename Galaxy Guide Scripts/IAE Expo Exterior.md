### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to "A Star Citizenâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy" Today I'll be giving you guys my thoughts on all of the RSI ships on display at the 2950 IEA Expo. This was recorded from my live stream yesterday, sorry for the delay in posting I was feeling burnt out and decided to take the evening off. There will be some fast forwarding to shorten its length, it is completely unscripted so take any hard facts with a grain of salt. If you'd like to get my thoughts on the other manufacturers check out this playlist in the info card above. I've done enough talking lets get to it.
