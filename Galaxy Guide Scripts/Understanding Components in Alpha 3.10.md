# Understanding weapons and components
## Components Guide
### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know to choose components for any ship and we're starting right now.

### Introduction
Thanks to all the support from Patrons and Channel Members it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated.
Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Guide to the Galaxy" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and In this guide I will explain my Understanding of Size, Grade, Class, EM, IR, and Draw Request Time that are common amongst almost all components and weapons in star citizen. I may be completely wrong about some of the info in this guide and that's OK because we are all learning throughout our journey in Star Citizens Alpha that is constantly changing. The pinned comment will be used to ensure accuracy. This is Part 1 of  a series that will cover each archetype of component and weapon in depth. So Make sure your subscribed and have the bell clicked for more. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
Let's talk briefly about some common metrics that all components have. Some of this information is copied from the wiki at over at starcitizen.tools. The RSI website is not recommended as a source for current and updated information on ships, components, or weapons. I highly recommend Erkul.Games your up-to-date info that is gathered straight from the games data.

### Size
The First is size. Component sizes range from 0 to 4.

* Size 0: Components are usually found on very small vehicles like rovers, buggies and bikes.
* Size 1: components are for small ships
* Size 2: for medium
* Size 3: for large
* size 4: Components are found on capital class ships like the 890 jump. This size is currently unavailable for purchase at stores in the verse.

The size of a ship's compatible components are determined by the manufacturer of the ship and are typically uniform across all 4 components. There are some instances where a ship can have multiple sized components but it's rare, some examples would be the Prospector, Banu Defender and 600i.

### Grade
Next we have the grade of a component, it can range from grade A to D. A Grade value is the easiest way to determine how well a component performs compared to other components in its size. It's important to know that Erkul.Games does not use A-D instead it uses values 1-4 extracted from Game Files.

* Grade D - Is the lowest grade, generally found on NPC or AI ships and some Drake ships
* Grade C - Are the standard item for most ships by default
* Grade B - Is a good upgrade to performance
* Grade A - Has the best possible performance

Knowing a components grade is a great way to decide what component to apply to your ship if you don't have much aUEC or time to research what is the absolute best for your situation. However Grade A components are not always the best for every situation.

### Class
Then we have a components class, this is something that is not fully fleshed out in the game's current state. There are five classes

* Military - Has the best overall at that item’s functionality, at the expense of emissions and cost.
* Civilian - Is the most common, with a wide range of behaviors to suit cost, options to approximate all  other categories but not as specific.
* Stealth - Have vastly reduced signatures & consumption at the expense of functionality.
* Industrial - Have reliably high output and low wear, with high emissions.
* Competition - Is higher performing than military but at the expense of durability and stealth, performance over everything.

A Components Class will be very important when degradation is implemented into the game. For example the competition zero rush will be great for a racing ship like the M50 for performance but will require frequent repairs. Very similar to the Pitstops seen in Formula 1 Racing. In addition it has also been stated that Class will be limited to a ships hull. For example a racing ship like the M50 will be limited to Competition class components. We are unsure when this limitation will be implemented so enjoy it while it lasts.

### Stealth
Next we have our stealth parameters Power to EM and Temperature to IR.

* Your EM signature is a measurement of your ship's Electromagnetic visibility. All components and weapons produce an EM signature and will broaden the distance that your ship will be visible to another ships' radar.
* IR Signature is a measurement of your ships Infrared visibility. The more heat your ship generates the higher your IR Signature. So just like EM the higher the number the further your ship will show up on another ship's radar.
* It's also important to know that the distance a ship is able to detect you is also dependent upon the size of the detecting ship's own SCANNER. There seems to be only 2 sizes of SCANNRS size 1 and 2. Size 1s are found in ships like light fighters and 2s in larger ships like the freelancer.

Scanners will detect whichever is greater between your EM and IR.
A good way to approximate your ships detection range is to use a formula I found from the Legacy Fleet Organization.
Take your highest value and multiply by .5 for size 1 scanners and .75 for size 2 scanners. This value is the distance your ship will be detected in kilometers.
There are also other factors like a ships stealth armor values but we'll cover those more in depth in a dedicated video.

### Power Draw Request Time
Now for one of the most overlooked and most important metrics across all components “Power Draw Request Time” on Erkul formerly PowerUpTime on Erkul or "TimeToReachDrawRequest" in the games data, or as I like to call it Request time. Whatever you like to call it Request time effects all components in a similar way. But to make things as simple as possible we'll use coolers as an example. Lets take a look at the awesome Zero Rush it has a cooling rate of 238kilos/per second and a Request Time of 3 seconds. What you have to understand is from the start the zero rush does not cool at the rate of 238k it is actually cooling at an idle rate, if your powered up. Request time is the amount of time in seconds that it takes for the cooler to get from 0 to the max rate of 238kps. So for our example the Zero Rush will take a little less than 3 seconds to reach the 238k if going from idle to its max rate. Or the full 3 seconds from a cold start either because you just powered up your ship or starting to recover from an EMP. I'll cover coolers in greater depth in part 2 of this series. As far as other components Shields Request Time is time to Max Regen Rate, Power Plant Request Time is Time to Max Power Draw, and for QT drives well honestly I don't know but I hope to have more info when I make an in-depth guide on QT Drives.

### Outro
I hope you've enjoyed this basic overview of components in star citizen. In Part 2 in this series will take an in depth look into coolers, it will be added to the info & end card once it's complete.
