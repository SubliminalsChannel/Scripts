@HarrisHeller I was exclusively a YT Creator. Your vids have inspired me to start streaming. To everyone watching I have a small 20k YT channel and I reached affiliate within 7 Days. This month Twitch brought more income than YouTube AdSense. I'm not saying this for self promotion I'm trying to emphasize how much Harris is right about making content on other social platforms. IT WORKS! Is 75 average viewers the hardest requirement for partner?

@HarrisHeller You dont need to read this aloud. To what you described about conceiving, me and my wife went through the same thing. I know its hard to talk about. And this may not be something you want to hear right now but know I we in the same boat. We are just a couple of years down river.  In September my wife and I will adopt our 2 year old foster son. He's the best thing that has happened to us, and I wouldn't change the past if I could rewrite it.
