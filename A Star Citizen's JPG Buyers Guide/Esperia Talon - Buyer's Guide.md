# Esperia Talon
## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Esperia Talon and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s JPEG Buyers Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we will be discussing what we know about the Newly Announced Tevarin Light Fighter The Esperia Talon. In this overview I will give a some back story on the talon, go over the features of the available variants, your purchase options, and give you my preliminary thought of the Talon. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
Lieutenant Webber Forbes once said. "THEY’D BE ON TOP OF YOU AND UNLEASH HELL BEFORE YOU COULD SCRAMBLE THE FIGHTERS. THEN THEY’D BE LONG GONE; DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE. AND YOU’D JUST BE A SITTING DUCK WITH YOUR COMMS FRIED, WAITING TO HEAR THAT WHISTLE AGAIN..."

The Talon is a recreation of the Tevarin light fighter of the same name by Esperia. The Talon is the Tevarin equivalent to the Aegis Gladius or Vanduul Blade; a single-seat combat ship. The Talon is the perfect example of the Tevarin way of building a spaceship: maneuverable with powerful, directional 'Phalanx' shields but weak physical armour, as the Tevarin way of war was to Strike first and Stike hard, before using their Phalanx shields to cover their escape.

Shrikes are carnivorous (That means they eat meat) passerine birds of the family Laniidae. The family is composed of 33 species in four genera. The family name, and that of the largest genus, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for "butcher", and some shrikes are also known as butcherbirds because of their feeding habits.

### Available Variants
The Talon will come in 2 variants the Base model Talon and the Missile Throwing Talon Shrike. Lets go over the Talon first.
The cockpit has been modified for human use of course. This is what Esperia does. And they have kept the single stick control design we've seen on the prowler. Its cockpit will also feature an ejection system unlike prowler. This ejection system will jettison the cockpit away from the rest of the HULL. Due to the fact the cockpit is completely covered in armor my guess is that it will also feature a canopy that projects the outside view like the prowler.
The talons armor hull will feature stealth capabilities. It is my guess that this means there will be a 10%-30% reduction of EM IR & CS across the board like the Sabre and Eclipse. I'd guess they would go with 20%. This is great for stealth.
The Talon will come standard with 2 size 3 missiles racks, each holding 2 size 2 Tevarin missiles. These seem to be weapons that are not in the games data yet.
As for fire power the Talon will come stock with 2 Gimballed Size 3 Deadbolt III's. These weapons are in the games files but are currently not available in stores. I would take the data here with a grain of salt it is likely to release with different OP numbers people will bitch and it will get nerfed into oblivion. The size 4 -6 versions of the deadbolts are for sale in game if you would like to get a feel for them. They are very stealthy, boasting the lowest EM IR signatures in its class. For comparison the talon will have the same hardpoints as the recently buffed Khartu-Al. I'm getting excited. Although it is possible the gumballs will be locked. So Size 4s wont be an option.
As for the shields The Talon will be equipped with 2 size 1 Tevarin Phalanx Shields. Now I'm going to assume these will basically be size 1 versions of the Sukorans found on the prowler and Banu defender. If so they I will also assume they will have 100% ballistic resistance so you will need to take the talons shields all the way do before being able to damage the HUD. They should also have a large shield pool but suffer from an terrible request time that will make its regen atrociously long. I am now erect, however these are just my assumptions and I do not know this for sure.
There is also mention that the talon will have decoy counter measures that will create radar decoys of the talon. So if your opponent manages to survive a first Shrike they will be just as unlikely to mount a successful counter attack.

Lets talk now about the Shrike Variant.
The Cockpit will be the same as the base model.
The Hull will feature the same stealth tech but comes with a Special Edition color scheme inspired by the 26th Century Original. This seems to be just a change in the colored glass on the wing tips from the pearlescent green to purple.
Now where things get interesting The Talon Shrike will not come with the 2 Size three missiles racks, instead it will come with 2 Bespoke Missile racks with 12 SIZE 3 MISSILES. These are not specified to be Tevarin missiles so you can expect to add your own. This should keep you up at night because combined with the talons stealth capabilities being able to equip 24 missiles that have an over 10,000m lock range can be devastating. You will certainly be able to fire missiles from outside of the talons detection range.
Now before you start pulling out your credit card to buy this one. Lets talk about the fire power.
The Talon Shrike will come stock with 2 Gimballed Size 1 Deadbolt I's. This is a significant downside to the base-model so you will need to choose wisely.
And finally the Talon Shrike will have the same shield tech and counter measures as the base model.

### Purchase Options
The Talon and Shrike each have 2 different buying options each. The Base Talon is $90 Warbond (Meaning you will need to use some actual cash to purchase). This will include lifetime insurance, a VFG Industrial Hangar, Aves Helmet and, And the never before seen Aves Armor. The Shrike Warbond is also $90 and will come with the same inclusions. If you are unable to spend some actual cash then you can pay $10 more for the Base Talon and Shrike. However you will only receive 6-month insurance and will not receive the matching Aves armor.

The pair of ships are available in the following packs.
The Talon Twin Pack Warbond, that comes with both the base and shrike variants. This is a $10 savings over buying just one. And it includes the same extras.
They are also available in the Birds of Prey pack that includes, both talons, a prowler, anvil hawk and a Nox cue, as well as the extra goodies. I'm sure this has savings but I'm not sure someone let me know in the comments.
And if you baller status is over 9000 then you can purchase the Alien Complete Pack 2950 Warbond. With the included ships and goodies. You whales will have to pause it to read. Each of these packs are also available if you using store credit with the proper inflation added.
If look like the Aves helmet is on sale just like when the prowler went live but I see no sign of the Matching Armor. It looks as though it will be available for sale standalone when the ship is released
And lastly if you purchase the talon today, you will receive the khartu-Al as a loaner until the ship is released in December of this year. After yoiu watch this, make sure you check out my loadout guide of the Khartu-Al here and stay tuned until tomorrow morning for the full buyer's guide.

### My Thoughts
So... What are my thoughts? Well I pretty hyped. This ship really speaks to me. My name is SubliminaL for a reason I like to remain unseen until it too late. The Shrike seems pretty cool but I'm not a damn dirty missile throwing ape so I'm not sure if ill pick one up. Its astetics are excellent. I cant wait to see how the pearlescent armor looks in game. And I cant wait to kamikaze myself into other ships, people, and space stations. If the Talon releases with unlocked gimbals toting 2 size 4 weapon hardpoints, and size 1 versions of the sukorans, this may be my new favorite light fighter. If not I will have to try it out for myself to know for sure if ill like it. With that being said I will be melting my Khartu-Al, as I was wrapping up the full review when this was Announced. And I'll purchase the double pack. If the Talon turns out to be not as good as I'm expecting, then ill just melt it all. And if I cant live without the Khartu-Al ill pick it up when it is available for sale again. Expect a first look and full review in December when it is released, so make sure your subscribed and have the bell clicked.
