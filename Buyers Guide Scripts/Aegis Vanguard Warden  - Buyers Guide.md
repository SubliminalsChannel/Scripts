### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Aegis Vanguard Warden and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we'll be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Aegis Vanguard Warden. We'll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats with similar ships, review pros and cons, and I'll give you my thoughts on the Warden. If you haven't seen it, my Loadout Guide for the Vanguard Warden can be found here, and on the end screen. I go live on Twitch just before every YouTube release come and hang out.

### Overview
The Aegis A3G Vanguard Warden is a long-range military fighter which features extensive forward-mounted weaponry designed to tear through the shields and armor of other spacecraft. So-named because their multiple-jump range allows them to form the vanguard of any military expedition, Vanguards have seen extensive service against the Vanduul.
The Warden is manufactured by Aegis Dynamics, a Human spacecraft manufacturer based on Cestulus. Today, the company is a major manufacturer of both civilian and military crafts. The Vanguard Warden has 3 other variants, the e-Warfare Sentinel, the dropship hoplite, and the Fighter Bomber harbinger.
As of today, the Warden is not available for sale or upgrade on the pledge store standalone. But when it does it sells for $260, and for a very limited time. And the Warden is available for purchase in game for almost 3.4 Million aUEC. Now that you know a little bit more about the Aegis Vanguard Warden let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. The first thing we notice is the massive size 5 laser repeater under the nose. Above that we can see the 4 Proprietary laser canons in the nose. This is not the stock loadout. Here we can see the intakes and our retro thrusters glowing. I like this aesthetic feature. Way up above this we have a manned turret with 2 size 2 ballistic repeaters. Moving on beneath the hull we have the tracked landing gear exclusive to the vanguard series. Here we can see the vanguards wings are tucked away in landing mode. Around the rear we can see the dual main thrusters. Underneath here is where we have the main and only entrance into the vanguard. The starboard side is identical to the port side.

### Interior
Let's take a look inside. As we close the door we'll turn around to see where the quantum drive is stored. Heading back into the cabin, the port side has amenities like a nozzeltron for nozzeling and a food processor for processing food. Next to this we have a munitions locker with 4 weapon racks. Further down we have two beds that can be used to log out in. On the starboard side we have the avionics access panel. Next to this we have an engineering station, this isn't functional for me but I think this is a bug. Let me know down in the comments if you have this issue. Moving on we have an armor storage locker. And finally at the end we have the head, it has everything from a shower and first aid kit, to a sink and mirror. And you guessed it a hidden shitter! The turret is located in the middle of the cabin. Inside we can se that the turret doesn't have a great view but its not terrible. The Turret features a 2D radar and 4 MFDs, but no ejection feature. Lets head toward the flight deck. It does have a door to separate the pilot from the rest of the crew. On our way up we can see that there is a hidden compartment labeled Radar with a ghostly looking shield generator in it. The port side has shield 1, power plant 1, and life support. the starboard side has shield 2 and power plant 2. Getting closer to the cockpit we have our last set of component housings that house our coolers. Alright finally we've made our way to the cockpit, up top we have annunciator panels, below this a 3D radar, and 4 MFDs underneath. The vanguard warden does not yet have an ejection system.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, Some medium fighters, the other vanguard variants, and some multi-crew ships. The Google Sheet Document with this data is linked in the description.

* The Aegis Vanguard Warden weighs in at almost 239,000kg | Ties 8th Place
* It fits in at 38m in length | Ties in last Place with the vanguards, Freelancer, and Valkyrie.
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | As well as most other ships on this list
* Has a Max Crew Size of 3 | and Ties in 2nd place with the sentinel and cutlass black
* Carries 2500qfu | Ties in 2nd with the vanguards cutty and freelancer
* It Crawls by with an SCM speed of 169m/s | 8th place
* It strolls by gingerly with a Max Speed of 1116m/s | 5th place
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 54d/s | Ties in 4th Place
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 54d/s as well | And takes 3rd place this time
* It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 108d/s | Ties in 8th place
* It has a Total Hull HP of 25,000 | Ties 2nd place
* It has a physical armor damage reduction of 2% | Ties in 5th place
* It has an Energy armor damage reduction of 10% | Ties in 2nd with the cutty, hornet, and vanguards
* It has an EM IR & CS reduction of 0% | The only ship on this list with stealth reductions is the Sabre
* It blasts its way in with a Default Pilot DPS of 1,588 | 8th Place
* It shoots its way though with a Default turret DPS of 598 | And ties in 3rd Place with the MIS and hoplite.
* It has a stock missile payload of over 47,000 | Ties 4th place
* And the Aegis Vanguard Warden is available for sale in-game for a little under 3,400,000aUEC | And takes the 9th spot

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* It's weapon payload with a size 5 and 4 size 2s in unparalleled. Excluding the other vanguards of course.
* The weapon range of having a size 5 weapon on the nose is around 5,000m. That's a huge advantage. You can take our some enemies before they get into range to do any damage.
* The vanguard series has pretty good hull HP.
* It's armor has come physical and a decent amount of Energy reduction
* Having 2500 Quantum Fuel Units is nice. You can equip the fastest size 2 drive and still almost make a trip from PO to Microtech and Back
* Having the weapons center mounted is great because if you loose a wing you don't use fire power.
* And having the cabin space is great for box missions.
* Its stock missile payload is great as well with 4 size 4 Missile Racks

###### For cons, I'd say...
* It's SCM Speed is terrible
* Having bespoke weapons means you don't have as much of a variety of choices
* As well as having them fixed removes the option to be fully gimballed.
* It doesn't currently have an ejection feature
* And finally its price in game at 3.4 million aUEC is just insanity

### My Thoughts
So what are my thoughts, I have had sooooo much fun flying around in vanguards this past week. It has overtaken the Banu Defender as my every day driver because of its versatility, practicality, and devastating fire power. There isn't much I can't do, at least as far as combat is concerned, in a vanguard. It totes an abundance of firepower, missiles, with room for friends, and places for them to sleep. With all that being said... I don't think ill be adding the warden to my fleet, even though it is one of the best combat ships we have in the verse. And the reason for this isn't because the warden is a bad ship. It just has 2 siblings that have almost everything the warden has but either an EMP on the Sentinel or Torpedoes on the Harbinger, But until I get to fly them around in the verse my judgement is reserved. Make sure you are subscribed and have the bell clicked because my reviews of those are coming next.
