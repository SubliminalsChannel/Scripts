# Origin 100 Series Series
## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Origin 100 Series and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we'll be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Origin 100 Series. We'll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats with similar ships, review pros and cons, and I'll give you my thoughts on the 100 Series. I've decided to consolidate this as a review for the entire series due to their similarities. If you haven't seen it, my Loadout Guide for the 100 Series can be found here, and on the end screen. I go live on Twitch just before every YouTube release come and hang out. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
With all the class and sophistication you already associate with Origin Jumpworks, elegantly presented in an attractive, compact frame, the 100 series has been designed specifically for solo pilots looking to turn heads without sacrificing functionality or reliability.
The Origin 100i is a luxury starter ship that is the base variant of the 100 series. It features Origin Jumpworks' patented AIR Fuel System, making it the most efficient and eco-friendly ship on the market. The Origin 125a is a light fighter and starter ship that is the combat variant of the 100 series. Featuring a souped-up weapons package, and all the luxury and refinement you've come to expect from Origin, the 125a has been designed for the discerning maverick. The Origin 135c is a light freight and starter ship that is the cargo variant of the 100 series. The ship has a specific cargo module integrated in the underside rear of the ship to accommodate the additional capacity.
Origin Jumpworks is a personal luxury spacecraft and engine manufacturer based on Terra.
As of today, the 100i is available for $45 Warbond, the 125a for $55 Warbond, and the 135c for $60 Warbond. And if your using store credit just $5 more for each ship. You can buy the entire 100 series collection for $165 or $150 Warbond. And if you baller status is out of this world you can now buy the Origin Complete Pack for $2500 and $2650 Warbond respectively, and as you might guess it comes with every origin ship flight ready or not. The 100 Series is not available for purchase in game at the moment, more is it available as a loaner. Now that you know a little bit more about the Origin 100 Series let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. Lets start with the nose. Inside of the nose we have access to where the avionics component will be stored, this doesn't open just yet. Underneath the nose further than what I'm able to show you we access to the proprietary 100 series Dual Missile Rack. Moving on around the Port Side we get access to the Quantum drive this is actually functional. Moving further we have access to the cabin. Next to this in the wings we have the 100 series AiR system or Adaptive Intake Refinery that makes the 100 series so fuel efficient. Underneath each wings we have a gimballed size 2 laser cannon equipped stock. Also underneath each wing we have access to the coolers. I really like seeing physicalized components and cant wait to see it on more ships. All of this is found across all variants. As we get to the rear is where things start to get different. Underneath the 100i we have nothing, Underneath the 125a we have another bespoke missile rack that holds an additional 4 missiles on top of the front two, And lastly the 135C has an additional 4SCU of cargo on top of the 2SCU we'll see later in the cabin. Other than the entry door, the starboard side is identical to the port side.

### Interior
Let's take a look inside. As you can see the stairs to the 100i don't require an annoying animation to get in. This is great. The button to stow and extend the bed is not yet functional. On the back wall we have 2 buttons the first is to access the 2 SCU of cargo. And the second is to get access to the our cooler and shield generator. Heading to the flight deck we can see our standard building blocks HUD. Below this are a total of 4 MFDs and a 3D radar. There are also physical buttons for some of the ships functions. Another thing I look forward to seeing in more ships. It should be noted that the 100 series did go live with three paint options that are interchangeable throughout the series. The first is Blue Ametrine, Second is Slate Camo, and the third is Flame Paint. These are each available for $5 on the pledge store and also in a 12.50 combo pack.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, the standard and combat versions of the Aurora and Mustang, all of the 100 series variants, and some of the intermediate starters. The Google Sheet Document with this data is linked in the description.

* The Origin 100 Series weighs in at almost 0kg | Looks like the 100 Series is one of many ships that hasn't been given a weight value.
* They fit in at just 15m in length | 2nd Place, 1st place goes to the reliant and honestly its width negates its place here.
* They Tote 2scu of Cargo | 8th Place, As for the 135c it has 6scu and ties in 3rd with the Kore
* Have a Max Crew Size of 1 | The only ship on this list with more is the Kore with 2
* They carry 700qfu | Take 1st place
* They Cruise by with an SCM speed of 230 and 210m/s | Take 1st & Second place, with the 135c trailing behind in 5th place
* They stroll by gingerly with a Max Speed of 1150m/s for the 125a | Taking the 6th spot, and the 135 and 100i taking 9th and 10th
* They have a Maximum Pitch Rate of 78d/s | Taking 1st place
* They have a Maximum Yaw Rate of 76d/s | Ties in 1st with the Aurora MR
* They have a Maximum Roll Rate of 195d/s | Ties in 4th place
* They have a Total Hull HP of 3,550 | Comes in dead last. This should be taken with a grain of salt I had to pull this data from a new source due the inactivity of hardpoint.io
* They have a physical armor damage reduction of 1% | Ties in 5th place with the 300i
* They have a Energy armor damage reduction of 5% | Ties in 2nd place with most of the ships on this list
* They have a EM IR & CS reduction of 0% | No ships on this list have stealth armor
* They shoot peas with a Default Pilot DPS of 458 | 6th place with the mustang alpha
* The 100 series nore any other ships on this list have a turret
* They have a stock missile payload of over 7,500 | Ties 5th place, however the 135c has almost 23,000 and takes 1st
* And the Origin 100 Series are the only ships on this list not available for sale in-game | Although it is to be expected so close to being flight ready

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, in no particular order...
* Although its small the 100 series does get a 1% physical and 5% energy reduction from its armor.
* It's fuel efficiency is great, with the included Adaptive Intake Refinery and having 700 Quantum Fuel Units. The latter will allow you to equip a faster QT drive and get the same range as the usual atlas.
* Having the cabin space is great for box missions.
* They have beds to log out in
* The 125a has an excellent payload for a starter ship
* They all have a great very tiny crossection, much better than their bigger brothers.
* The Cargo Space in the 135c is a great benefit in a starter
* They all have pretty good SCM this is great for combat and certainly when degradation comes in.
* Their overheat resistance is great I can go from max speed almost down to a complete stop without overheating.
* And lastly their stealth emissions are great. Using my stealth build I struggled to get and IR over 10k while firing, maneuvering, and using afterburner.

###### That's all pretty impressive now lets look a the cons.
* Their max speed isn't all that great even in the fighter variant. But honestly this probably isn't that big of a deal.
* Having 2 size 3s on a starter is honestly not that bad however considering my final con I think it is an issue.
* Again my source for the 100 series Hull HP is new could be incorrect however unlikely its not soo far out of whack from the aurora series so its probably correct.
* I don't normally talk about this because it's relative and a lot of ships are purchasable in the verse. But the price is a problem for me.

### My Thoughts
So what are my thoughts?, The 100 series line of ships are stylish, fuel efficient, agile, and bring just enough fire power to not be ignored. The bed, cabin space and standard 2scu of cargo is great for a starting citizen to get their foothold into the verse. It's clear to me that between the 100 series, aurora, and mustang, the 100 series clearly comes out ahead. And it is my personal opinion that it is the best starter ship for new citizens. Hey subliminal have you checked out the price? Nah what is the 100i starter pack priced at like $50 US. Nope they have it priced at $60. Phhst... you said they want how much? $60 USD. Ok so then the 125a is like $65. Nope $70. Whhhhaaaaat. Then the 135c is $65 then. Wrong again its $75. Oh F@#K that! And these are all warbond prices. But my dude I can get an Avenger Titan Starter Pack for $70. It has 8Scu and the same amount of fire power if you knocked the size 4 off the nose. I don't know what to tell you man. Priced at this point I find my self hard-pressed to find someone in a scenario to where this would be good purchase. I thought the 100 series was supposed to be a true starter. However its being priced at an Intermediate Starter price. When recommending a ship to a new citizen there are a lot of choices. The $70 Avenger Titan is a great one, You could also upgrade a base mustang to a 300i for $30, bringing your total investment to around $75 or for another $5 you could do the same thing and get a 315p. Now ere kind of out of the starter ship territory but I think you get what im saying. I really do hate to base a review so heavily on price but I just cant get past this one. For now I will just have to keep an eye open for when the 100 series becomes available in the verse to see if its something worth using as a snub for the games larger ships.
