# Anvil Hawk
## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Anvil Hawk and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we'll be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Anvil Hawk. We'll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats with similar ships, review pros and cons, and I'll give you my thoughts on the Hawk. If you havent seen it, my Loadout Guide for the Anvil Hawk can be found here, and on the end screen. I go live on Twitch just before every YouTube release come and hang out. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

*New citizens, can use my referral code on screen or the link in the description to reserve their 5000aUEC in the PU, no pledge necessary.*

### Overview
Initially developed as a dogfighter and ground attack vehicle in 2937, the Anvil Hawk saw only limited operations while in UEEN service. In response to this, Anvil developed a civilian model aimed at the bounty hunter market in 2940. The new model added a selection of EMP weaponry and a containment pod capable of carrying a passenger or prisoner.
Anvil Aerospace is a Human spacecraft manufacturing corporation founded in 2772 that produces both military and civilian crafts. The F7 Hornet and the F8 Lightning are among the Anvil spacecraft currently produced for all branches of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military. Since the foundation of the company, all final designs of spacecraft must be approved by the CEO. They are headquartered on Terra.
As of today, the Hawk is not available for sale or upgrade on the pledge store standalone. But when it does it sells for $100, and for a very limited time. However it is available today in the new "Birds of Prey" pack for $670 with both Talons and the prowler. And in the very popular Scoundrel Pack for $695 with the ships shown here. And the Hawk is available for purchase in game for almost 1.3 Million aUEC. Now that you know a little bit more about the Anvil Hawk let's take a tour.

[comment]: # (It is available as a loaner for Ares Ion & Inferno Owners. And for owning one you will receive a super hornet as a loaner for arena commander.)

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. Initially the hawk doesn't look much like a bird when you first look at it. On the tip of the nose we have standard sensors found on spacecrafts in star citizen. Underneath that we have a nice viewport to the cockpit. Underneath that we have 2 size 1 hardpoints. FYI this is not the stock loadout. Just behind the chicken leg we have a size 2 weapon hardpoint. Up top above the wing we have another size 2 hardpoint on each side. From the side we can see it certainly does have a bird look to it. Around the rear we have access to the prisoner pod. Tucked away over here we have the main thrusters. The starboard side is identical to the port side. Lets take a closer look at the prisoner pod. You can actually place yourself inside. And you even have the ability to logout.

### Interior
Let's climb inside. Similar to a lot of anvil ships the cockpit extends the pilot seat down to pick up the pilot. Inside we have the now standard building blocks UI HUD. Below this we have annunciator panels, and below those we have 4 MFDs and a 3D radar. The hawk does have an ejection feature.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, alot of light fighters, some bounty hunting, and some popular EMP ships. The Google Sheet Document with this data is linked in the description.

* The Anvil Hawk weighs in at exactly 40,000kg | 3rd Place
* It fits in at 17m in length | 4th Place
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | As well as most other ships on this list.
* Has a Max Crew Size of 1 | Again like most ships compared.
* Carries 583qfu | Only the Cutty Blue and Sentinel have more than this.
* It cruises by with an SCM speed of 225m/s | 1st Place
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1,315m/s | 3rd Place just 8 scm behind first.
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 75d/s | 1st Place
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 8d/s | And takes 1st place again
* Surprisingly it has a Maximum Roll Rate of 135d/s | 5th Place
* It has a Total Hull HP of 7,200 | And takes 5th place
* It has a physical armor damage reduction of 4% | Ties in 3rd place
* It has an Energy armor damage reduction of 10% | Ties in 2nd with 6 other ships compared.
* It has an EM IR & CS reduction of 0% | The only ship on this list with stealth reductions is the Khartu-Al
* It blasts it way in with a Default Pilot DPS of over 1,900 | 3rd Place
* The Hawk does not have a turret.
  [comment]: # (It shoots its way though with a Default turret DPS of almost 1,400 | It takes first place of course and this is well deserved.)
* Nor does it have missiles.
  [comment]: # (It has a stock missile payload of almost 15,000 | It ties in 8th place with the banu defender.)
* However the Anvil Hawk is available for sale in-game for just under 1,300,000aUEC | And takes the 6th spot

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* Its small and when in flight mode its front cross-section isn't terrible.
* It has a fast SCM speed, that's great for combat
* Very fast MAX speed for outrunning and catching enemies.
* with 4 size 2s and 2 size ones it has a high damage potential
* Its very nimble in regards to pitch and yaw
* It has excellent acceleration this is great considering it's short range of fire.
* It has an EMP
* And although its claustrophobics nightmare. You can log out in its poisoner pod.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* Its a glass cannon, it cannot sustain much damage.
* It is a ship that requires skill and situational awareness.
* Unfortunately loosing a wing means you loose a gun. And this isn't a hard thing to do. Reducing your DPS.
* And this wouldn't be that big of a deal with such high DPS, but considering the next con, I think its worth mentioning it doesn't have missiles.
* And my biggest gripe... the weak EMP

### My Thoughts
So what are my thoughts, the Hawk is a very fast, very quick, very nimble light fighter with a high damage potential. What more can you ask for in a light fighter? On paper its great. Sure it cant take much of a beating but in the right hands it can be deadly. The problem is in the right hands, an arrow or gladius can be deadly as well. And I think those require less skill to achieve that goal. But subliminal your forgetting about the EMP. What EMP? This one? Recently the EMP was nerfed and in standard nerf fashion they don't just nerf it nerf it, they nerf it into uselessness. The Hawk is another ship that I like but don't love. I have hopes that they will take feedback from the community and bring the hawks EMP to a reasonable level. If not we will have to wait and see if bounty hunting will assist in its viability. Until then the warlock or Sentiel will be my recommended for EMP warfare.
