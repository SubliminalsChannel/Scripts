# Anvil Gladiator
## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Anvil Gladiator and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we'll be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Anvil Gladiator. We'll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats with similar ships, review pros and cons, and I'll give you my thoughts on the Gladiator. If you haven't seen it, my Loadout Guide for the Anvil Gladiator can be found here, and on the end screen. I go live on Twitch just before every YouTube release come and hang out. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
The Gladiator is a two-seat light bomber developed by Anvil Aerospace for the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN). It was designed as a combination fighter-bomber companion to Anvil's F7A Hornet line of spacecraft, offering the UEEN the ability to significantly increase the overall offensive power of smaller escort carriers and support ships. The Gladiator has been a key part of the UEEN's skirmisher forces since the 2930s and was recently made available to the civilian market for private enterprises and militia groups.
Anvil Aerospace is a Terra based, Human spacecraft manufacturing corporation founded in 2772 that produces both military and civilian crafts. The F7 Hornet and the F8 Lightning are among the Anvil spacecraft currently produced for all branches of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military. Since the foundation of the company, all final designs of spacecraft must be approved by the CEO.
As of today, the Gladiator is not available for sale or upgrade on the pledge store standalone. But when it does it sells for $165, and for a very limited time. It is available as a loaner for Retaliator Owners. And the Gladiator is available for purchase in game for almost 2 Million aUEC. Now that you know a little bit more about the Anvil Gladiator let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. The first thing I notice is the Gladiators broad stance. It has landing gear in the front back and on each wing. Up top above the cockpit we have the non slaved gunner controlled turret. Underneath we have the torpedo bay door with 4 size 5 missiles. The first thing we see under the wing is the fixed size three weapon hardpoint that is pilot controlled. Followed by 2 size three missile racks, each holding 2 size 2 missiles. I love how that landing gear tucks into the wing. Around the rear we can see its dual main thrusters. I think the rear of the gladiator is beautiful. Also the nose isn't bad either. Agound level walk around doesn't really do the gladiator justice. From the top here we can see this dome. I'm not 100% sure what this will be in the future but here is a quote from starcitizen.toos. I'm skeptical of this becoming a reality because it is not mentioned on the galactepedia page. But it sounds cool.

### Interior
Let's climb inside the cockpit first. Similar to a lot of anvil ships the cockpit extends the pilot seat down to pick up the pilot. Inside we have the now standard building blocks UI HUD. Above this we have annunciator panels, and below those we have a 3d radar. Further down we have 6 MFDs. The Gladiator does have an ejection feature. Lets take a look at the turret seat. It also extends from the same opening as the pilots, and is technically visible behind the cockpit. The turret gunner has access to 4 MFDs and a 2D radar. It Also doesn't seem to have an ejection feature. It does however have some of the best visibility I've seen from a turret on a ship.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, alot of light fighters, some bounty hunting, and some popular EMP ships. The Google Sheet Document with this data is linked in the description.

* The Anvil Gladiator weighs in at over 87,000kg | 5th Place
* It fits in at 22.5m in length | Ties in 4th Place
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | As well as most other ships on this list
* Has a Max Crew Size of 2 | and Ties in 6th Place
* Carries 583qfu | Ties in last place with 3 other ships compared.
* It Crawls by with an SCM speed of 151m/s | 7tht Place
* It strolls by gingerly with a Max Speed of 983m/s | 7th Place again
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 70d/s | 1st Place
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 70d/s as well | And takes 1st place again, these are totally unexpected.
* It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 104d/s | 5th Place
* It has a Total Hull HP of 7,800 | And takes 9th place
* It has a physical armor damage reduction of 4% | Ties in 3rd place
* It has an Energy armor damage reduction of 10% | Ties in 2nd with 6 other ships compared.
* It has an EM IR & CS reduction of 0% | The only ship on this list with stealth reductions is the Eclipse
* It shoots peas with a Default Pilot DPS of under 1,000 | 8th Place
* It shoots its way though with a Default turret DPS of almost 880 | And ties in 4th Place with he Cutty black.
* It has a stock missile payload of over 64,000 | Its takes 7th place surprisingly but keep in mind pound for pound its excellent.
* However the Anvil Gladiator is available for sale in-game for a little under 2,000,000aUEC | And takes the 4th spot

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* Pound for pound its missile payload is great
* And the 31,000 Range of those torps means that if you can see your target you can probably lock them
* Considering its payload its pretty small
* Its also pretty nimble with excellent Max pitch and yaw Repeaters
* Its one of few ships that have a Physical and Energy damage reduction
* For such a small ship its turret damage potential is pretty good. Equivalent to the cutlass blacks turret
* having the ability to bring along another player is great
* And having a mid 4000 IR signature while resting means it can be pretty stealthy if properly equipped

###### For cons, I'd say...
* Its pilot damage potential is not great with just 2 size 3s
* Its Hull HP is pretty bad but this seems to be a characteristic of bombers in more than just star citizen.
* Is speed is terrible as well with atrociously low Max and SCM speeds
* This is just my opinion but I think bombers should have extended range quantum fuel tanks and the gladiator has the minimum.
* Also another opinion of mine is that bombers should also have a size 2 radar. Because gladiators size 1 radar it cant take full advantage of the 30k lock range of the size 5 missiles.
* And lastly It's top crosssection terrible. If you get caught from the top or bottom its a wrap.

### My Thoughts
So what are my thoughts, the Gladiator fits into a roll of its own. Its something that I think is needed in StarCitizen to have diversity amongst different classes of ships. It's a small bomber with torpedo's and if properly equipped can maintain enough stealth to certainly lock and fire missiles outside of its detection range. This is what makes the Gladiator great, however I don't think its enough to get players to actually purchase and fly one. Don't believe me? Leave a comment below if you have either never heard of this ship or simply forgot about its existence. What can CIG do to fix this? Well a buff would be nice. Since bringing another player along while your stealthily hunting player bounties, that will probably just run and combat log, isn't fun. Why not slave the turret to the pilots controls. This would give the Gladiator more viability against PVE encounters. You can use it like a light fighter with a heavy missile payload. Or they can buff the weapons sizes similar to what we just saw them do with the hurricane. Plus the size 5 missiles aren't strong enough to take down larger ships like fully upgraded vanguards or anything with more shield capacity. So this is a light fighter and medium size bomber. Further niching itself, and giving more toward the argument of needing a buff. Another important point, is the price. $165 compared to the $290 harbinger seems reasonable considering its capabilities. However its in-game price is outrageous at just 100k aUEC less than the harbinger. Rendering this limited sale on the pledge store ship, useless to buy in the verse. If it were priced more in line with the anvil hurricane it could possibly make more since. With all this being said the gladiator is another ship that isn't bad but just doesn't have much reason to purchase it in game or outside of it.
