# Anvil Hurricane
## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Anvil Hurricane and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we will be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Anvil Hurricane. In this review, we'll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats with similar ships, review pros and cons, and give you my thoughts on the Hurricane. If you haven't seen it already after this review check out my loadout guide for the Anvil Hurricane in the info card above, and on the end screen. I'm live right now! Head over to twitch to hang out and give me your thoughts on the Hurricane. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

*New citizens, can use my referral code on screen or the link in the description to reserve their 5000aUEC in the PU, no pledge necessary.*

### Overview
The Anvil A4A Hurricane is a fighting spacecraft that packs a deadly punch into a light fuselage. The spacecraft compensates for its lack of creature comforts with its powerful armament: Two size 4 Pilot and 4 size 3 Turret mounted guns capable of blasting their way through nearly anything. Hurricane pilots have yet to find an enemy shield they can't knock down. The Hurricane is fast, but not nimble, and is designed to charge in to threatened areas before rushing back out to regroup. It is a close- to mid-range ship, similar to the Gladius. It is designed to work with other fighters and support ships rather than for long-range patrols. A small power plant, zero cargo space, and weak shields and hull emphasize its role as a fragile attack ship; relying on the raw speed of its engine and the hull-busting power of its guns to protect itself.
Anvil Aerospace is a Human spacecraft manufacturing corporation founded in 2772 that produces both military and civilian crafts. The F7 Hornet and the F8 Lightning are among the Anvil spacecraft currently produced for all branches of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military. Since the foundation of the company, all final designs of spacecraft must be approved by the CEO. They are headquartered on Terra.
As of today, the Hurricane is not available for sale or upgrade on the pledge store. But when it does it sells for $170, and for a very limited time. It is available as a loaner for Ares Ion & Inferno Owners. And for owning one you will receive a super hornet as a loaner for arena commander. I can confirm that the Super Hornet Loaner is also available in the Persistent Universe.
And the Hurricane is available for purchase in game for just over 1.2 Million aUEC. Now that you know a little bit more about the Anvil Hurricane let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. On the nose you can see gimballed size 3 Ballistic Scatterguns. These can be replaced with fixed size 4 weapons if you whish. There are a couple of things I don't like, the chroma key green landing gear and the Red accent color. But maybe a purchasable skin can fix this at a later date. Good thing is it cant really be seen while flying or in most 3rd person shots. Tucked inside the wings we have 2 size 2 missile racks with 1 size 2 missile each. Not sure why we didn't get 1 size three missile rack so we could have the option of using 1 size 3 missile instead but it look intentional. Up top you can see the 4 that's right 4 size 3 weapons on the turret. I'm a huge fan of the Anvil wing tip hooks. Around the rear you can see its dual main thrusters that help it achieve that well over 1200m/s top speed. The Starboard side is identical to the port side.

### Interior
Let's op inside the Turret Seat. It comes with 4 MFDs and a 2D radar. It doesn't appear to have an ejection feature. The new turret hut is a well needed update. Lets head inside the Pilots cockpit. It does have the new building block UI although I think I can stop saying that now. Its annunciator panels are located on the top port side of the cockpit.
It has a holo radar an 4 MFDs. The pilot certainly has an ejection feature.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, a heavy fighter, some medium fighters, and some multi-crew combat ships. The Google Sheet Document with the data is linked in the description.

* The Anvil Hurricane weighs in at over 86,000kg | 6th Place
* It fits in at 22m in length | 2nd Place
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | As well as most other ships on this list.
* Has a Max Crew Size of 2 | And ties in 3rd place with most ships on this list
* Carries 583qfu | It ties last place with most of the ships compared.
* It cruises by with an SCM speed of 198m/s | 3rd Place
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1,232m/s | 2st Place
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 55d/s | Ties 7th Place with the super Hornet
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 50d/s | Ties in 8th Place with the super hornet again.
* And It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 135d/s | 3rd Place
* It has a Total Hull HP of almost 5,500 | This is a true glass cannon my friends.
* It has a physical armor damage reduction of 4% | Ties in 2nd place
* It has an Energy armor damage reduction of 10% | Ties in 1st with 5 other ships compared.
* It has an EM IR & CS reduction of 0% | The only ship on this list with stealth reductions are the Sabre and Prowler
* It blasts it way in with a Default Pilot DPS of over 2400 | Before you get you panties in a bunch it comes equipped with short range high dps ballistic scatterguns.
* It shoots its way though with a Default turret DPS of almost 1,400 | It takes first place of course and this is well deserved.
* It has a stock missile payload of almost 15,000 | It ties in 8th place with the banu defender.
* And the Anvil Hurricane is available for sale in-game for over 1,200,000aUEC | And takes the number one spot

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* Compared to most ship with this much firepower it is very small.
* It has excellent acceleration and top speed.
* Its one of the few ships with physical and energy reducing armor
* The pilot weapon range potential is great due to its size 4 hardpoints. CF series repeaters can hit out to 4,000m
* This kind of goes without being said but its turret DPS potential is out matched.
* And overall for such a small ship it DPS is again out classed.
* Now for some of my feelings and opinions. Its atmospheric flight speeds are off the charts. You can easily hit high 400s of possibly 500m/s in atomo.
* And lastly Is only effective with 2 player pilots. I personally think we need more ships like this in the verse, that reward teamplay.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* It has a low missile count. Although honestly considering its weapon firepower I'm ok with that.
* It's not very nimble with a slow pitch, yaw, and roll.
* It also requires a lot of power and cooling. Running my loadout I was pushing my JS-300 and Dual Zero Rushes to their limits.
* Now for some major ones. That Hull HP... Look if you see your shields are anywhere near close to down, just get out of there.
* And Lastly because some of you may not agree with my pro. One of its biggest cons is it requires a 2nd player. I would not recommend going out in this to fight solo.

### My Thoughts
So what are my thoughts, I freaking love this ship. With the buffs added in 3.10 it makes this ship viable again. But also not OP. If the pilot and turret gunner aren't coordinated, you will fail, there isn't much margin of error with such low HP. But once you reach that synergy, taking down opponents is a blast. The whole idea of this ship, just brings me joy. Frankly it takes time for 2 people to get coordinated in this game. Hey man you want to fly around in my hurricane and wreck shit up. Sure, Subliminal. Ok where you at? Area 18 Well I'm at MicroTech. Ok meet half way? Sure well meet at a rest stop. "A Few Moments Later" Where you at bro you rockin' that agonizing Agni QT drive or something? I'm almost there calm down. Sorry I cant see your pip. Ok I'm here. What pad you landing on? I don't know there are no numbers. Alright ill play elevator roullett then. That's the wrong one man, but your close. Fuck it ill just EVA over. Ok lets fly to Hurston and pick up some bounties. I'm down lets go. Alright lets see what bounties we got. I don't have any, shit I haven't done my pro tiem yet have you? No I haven't either. Fuck, alright Lets do it. Where is yours? Near Crusader. Damnit. Alright lets head over there. FUCK!!! Anybody who has the patience to get through that shit is deserves a slight advantage. I sincerely hope the Turret on the Hurricane NEVER gets slaved to the pilot like the hornet. It would be way too much DPS and frankly ruin a really fun style of gameplay. If you're a lone wolf you cant be effective in this ship, just like you couldn't be effective if you hopped into a hammerhead by yourself. We need one more small size ships like this in the verse.
