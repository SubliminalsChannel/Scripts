# Anvil Hurricane
## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Anvil Hurricane and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we will be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Anvil Hurricane. In this review, we'll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats with similar ships, review pros and cons, and give you my thoughts on the Hurricane. If you haven't seen it already after this review check out my loadout guide for the Anvil Hurricane in the info card above, and on the end screen. I'm live right now! Head over to twitch to hang out and give me your thoughts on the Hurricane. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

*New citizens, can use my referral code on screen or the link in the description to reserve their 5000aUEC in the PU, no pledge necessary.*

### Overview
The Anvil A4A Hurricane is a fighting spacecraft that packs a deadly punch into a light fuselage. The spacecraft compensates for its lack of creature comforts with its powerful armament: Two size 4 Pilot and 4 size 3 Turret mounted guns capable of blasting their way through nearly anything. Hurricane pilots have yet to find an enemy shield they can't knock down. The Hurricane is fast, but not nimble, and is designed to charge in to threatened areas before rushing back out to regroup. It is a close- to mid-range ship, similar to the Gladius. It is designed to work with other fighters and support ships rather than for long-range patrols. A small power plant, zero cargo space, and weak shields and hull emphasize its role as a fragile attack ship; relying on the raw speed of its engine and the hull-busting power of its guns to protect itself.
Anvil Aerospace is a Human spacecraft manufacturing corporation founded in 2772 that produces both military and civilian crafts. The F7 Hornet and the F8 Lightning are among the Anvil spacecraft currently produced for all branches of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military. Since the foundation of the company, all final designs of spacecraft must be approved by the CEO. They are headquartered on Terra.
As of today, the Hurricane is not available for sale or upgrade on the pledge store. But when it does it sells for $170, and for a very limited time. It is available as a loaner for Ares Ion & Inferno Owners. And for owning one you will receive a super hornet as a loaner for arena commander. I can confirm that the Super Hornet Loaner is also available in the Persistent Universe.
And the Hurricane is available for purchase in game for just over 1.2 Million aUEC. Now that you know a little bit more about the Anvil Hurricane let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. On the nose you can see gimballed size 3 Ballistic Scatterguns. These can be replaced with fixed size 4 weapons if you whish. There are a couple of things I don't like, the chroma key green landing gear and the Red accent color. But maybe a purchasable skin can fix this at a later date. Good thing is it cant really be seen while flying or in most 3rd person shots. Tucked inside the wings we have 2 size 2 missile racks with 1 size 2 missile each. Not sure why we didn't get 1 size three missile rack so we could have the option of using 1 size 3 missile instead but it look intentional. Up top you can see the 4 that's right 4 size 3 weapons on the turret. I'm a huge fan of the Anvil wing tip hooks. Around the rear you can see its dual main thrusters that help it achieve that well over 1200m/s top speed. The Starboard side is identical to the port side.

### Interior
Let's op inside the Turret Seat. It comes with 4 MFDs and a 2D radar. It doesn't appear to have an ejection feature. The new turret hut is a well needed update. Lets head inside the Pilots cockpit. It does have the new building block UI although I think I can stop saying that now. Its annunciator panels are located on the top port side of the cockpit.
It has a holo radar an 4 MFDs. The pilot certainly has an ejection feature.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, a heavy fighter, some medium fighters, and some multi-crew combat ships. The Google Sheet Document with the data is linked in the description.

* The Anvil Hurricane weighs in at over 86,000kg | 6th Place
* It fits in at 22m in length | 2nd Place
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | As well as most other ships on this list.
* Has a Max Crew Size of 2 | And ties in 3rd place with most ships on this list
* Carries 583qfu | It ties last place with most of the ships compared.
* It cruises by with an SCM speed of 198m/s | 3rd Place
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1,232m/s | 2st Place
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 55d/s | Ties 7th Place with the super Hornet
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 50d/s | Ties in 8th Place with the super hornet again.
* And It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 135d/s | 3rd Place
* It has a Total Hull HP of almost 5,500 | This is a true glass cannon my friends.
* It has a physical armor damage reduction of 4% | Ties in 2nd place
* It has an Energy armor damage reduction of 10% | Ties in 1st with 5 other ships compared.
* It has an EM IR & CS reduction of 0% | The only ship on this list with stealth reductions are the Sabre and Prowler
* It blasts it way in with a Default Pilot DPS of over 2400 | Before you get you panties in a bunch it comes equipped with short range high dps ballistic scatterguns.
* It shoots its way though with a Default turret DPS of almost 1,400 | It takes first place of course and this is well deserved.
* It has a stock missile payload of almost 15,000 | It ties in 8th place with the banu defender.
* And the Anvil Hurricane is available for sale in-game for over 1,200,000aUEC | And takes the number one spot

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* It's its very fast in regards to SCM and Max speed.
* It's Nimble in regards to pitch, yaw, and roll
* Its damage potential at range is great with its size 4 hardpoints. You can hit targets up to 4,000 meters away.
* Now for some things we cant see on paper. Its stealth capabilities are great. I recorded an IR between 4,300 and 5,000 while maneuvering and firing as long as you don't use afterburner.
* It's acceleration is great so much so that you don't need to use afterburner but when you do its even faster.
* I also felt like it could space break "almost" to a complete stop without overheating.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* It doesn't have missiles. I'm actually OK with this but still think it should be mentioned.
* Its view from the cockpit is pretty bad its hard to see around those dome struts.
* It's surface area is terrible. It seems like the designers got together and said how can we make this ship catch every single bullet thrown its way. Well lets make it look like an open hand.
* And I don't normally add this to pros and cons because value is relative, but the Hurricane certainly has its alien tax applied.

### My Thoughts
So what are my thoughts, well the Hurricane absolutely dominates the board when it comes to every speed metric. It's stealth capabilities should keep you up at night. I was able to create a build that if used properly would allow you to attack outside of the Hurricane's detection range. This is great for taking PVP bounties if done correctly. And Its fucking dope looking, have you see this thing change flight modes? All that being said its cons are pretty beefy, its cockpit view isn't great, its cool design makes it an easy target from almost all angles, and at $170 dollars US I can get a couple of great light fighters. And it really pains me to say this because I like this ship. So I'll just have to buy it in game.
