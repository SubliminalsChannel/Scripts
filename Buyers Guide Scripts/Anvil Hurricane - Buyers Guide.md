# Aopoa Khartu-Al
## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Aopoa Khartu-Al and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we will be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Aopoa Khartu-Al. In this review, we'll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats with similar ships, review pros and cons, and give you my thoughts on the Khartu-Al. If you haven't seen it already after this review check out my loadout guide for the Aopoa Khartu-Al in the info card above, and on the end screen. I'm live right now! Head over to twitch to hang out and give me your thoughts on the Khartu-Al. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
The Anvil A4A Hurricane is a fighting spacecraft that packs a deadly punch into a light fuselage. The spacecraft compensates for its lack of creature comforts with its powerful armament: Two size 4 Pilot and 4 size 3 Turret mounted guns capable of blasting their way through nearly anything. Hurricane pilots have yet to find an enemy shield they can't knock down. The Hurricane is fast, but not nimble, and is designed to charge in to threatened areas before rushing back out to regroup. It is a close- to mid-range ship, similar to the Gladius. It is designed to work with other fighters and support ships rather than for long-range patrols. A small power plant, zero cargo space, and weak shields and hull emphasize its role as a fragile attack ship; relying on the raw speed of its engine and the hull-busting power of its guns to protect itself. 
Aopoa is a Xi’an House and spacecraft manufacturer. They hold a monopoly granted by the Xi’an government to exclusively manufacture light craft, such as the Khartu-al (Kal’tuāl) and the San'tok.yāi. One of a growing number of Xi’an corporations that market their products to Humans, Aopoa has sponsored multiple marketing events highlighting the exchange between Human and Xi’an cultures. In 2910, they partnered with Musashi Industrial and Starflight Concern (MISC) to market their products to Humans. Their logo incorporates the crest of the Imperial House Kr.ē.
As of today, the Khartu-Al is available for sale and upgrade on the pledge store for $170 for a very limited time. It is available as a loaner for San'Tok.yai Owners.
And the Khartu-Al is available for purchase in game for just over 2.1 Million aUEC. Now that you know a little bit more about the Aopoa Khartu-Al let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. As you can see the Khartu-Al very unique in its design. On the tip of the nose you can see a warm bright light. Throughout the underside of the ship you can see green accent lighting, I quite like this. Up here inside of this dome is the cockpit. Up and to the right we have the size 4 weapon hardpoint stock equipped with a gimballed size three laser repeater. Here is one of the 4 articulating main thrusters that allow the Khartu-Al to be so nimble. And this is the second one on the port side. Lets step back and look at the tail. I really like the gold trim here. Works well with the warm tail light. This design would make for a great carbon fiber combat knife. From this angle you can see it almost kind of looks like a flower. The starboard side is identical to the port side.

### Interior
Let's head inside. Watch this look at the floating steps! Inside we can see that the building blocks UI is implemented and is colored to match the orange UI of the Khartu-Al. We also have a holographic radar and 3 MFDs although the last one isn't very visible. The Khartu-Al does not have an ejection feature.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, some light fighters, some alien light and medium fighters. The Google Sheet Document with the data is linked in the description.

* The Aopoa Khartu-Al weighs in at over 67,000kg | 7th Place
* It fits in at 31.5m in length | 9th Place
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | As well as every ship on this list except the 325a
* Has a Max Crew Size of 1 | As well as every ship on this list except the Banu Defender
* Carries 583qfu | Again like all the other ships except the Defender
* It cruises by with an SCM speed of 224m/s | 3rd Place just 1 meter per second away from tying in first
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1,323m/s | 1st Place
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 70d/s | 4th Place
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 70d/s as well | 3rd Place
* And It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 270d/s | 2nd Place
* It has a Total Hull HP of almost 11,000 | 1st Place (this should be taken with a grain of salt. this metric totals up the HP of every piece of hull. And since the Khartu-Al has so much surface area it scores high.)
* It has a physical armor damage reduction of 0% | Ties in last place
* It has an Energy armor damage reduction of 0% | Ties in last place Again
* It has an EM IR & CS reduction of 10% | and is 2nd only to the Sabre
* It shoots peas with a Default Pilot DPS of just 880 | Last place (Check out my loadout guide to remedy this)
* The Khartu-Al nor any other ship compared has a turret
* The Khartu-Al does not have missiles
* And the Aopoa Khartu-Al is available for sale in-game for over 2,100,000aUEC | And takes the 6th spot

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* It's its very fast in regards to SCM and Max speed.
* It's Nimble in regards to pitch, yaw, and roll
* Its damage potential at range is great with its size 4 hardpoints. You can hit targets up to 4,000 meters away.
* Now for some things we cant see on paper. Its stealth capabilities are great. I recorded an IR between 4,300 and 5,000 while maneuvering and firing as long as you don't use afterburner.
* It's acceleration is great so much so that you don't need to use afterburner but when you do its even faster.
* I also felt like it could space break "almost" to a complete stop without overheating.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* It doesn't have missiles. I'm actually OK with this but still think it should be mentioned.
* Its view from the cockpit is pretty bad its hard to see around those dome struts.
* It's surface area is terrible. It seems like the designers got together and said how can we make this ship catch every single bullet thrown its way. Well lets make it look like an open hand.
* And I don't normally add this to pros and cons because value is relative, but the Khartu-Al certainly has its alien tax applied.

### My Thoughts
So what are my thoughts, well the Khartu-Al absolutely dominates the board when it comes to every speed metric. It's stealth capabilities should keep you up at night. I was able to create a build that if used properly would allow you to attack outside of the Khartu-Al's detection range. This is great for taking PVP bounties if done correctly. And Its fucking dope looking, have you see this thing change flight modes? All that being said its cons are pretty beefy, its cockpit view isn't great, its cool design makes it an easy target from almost all angles, and at $170 dollars US I can get a couple of great light fighters. And it really pains me to say this because I like this ship. So I'll just have to buy it in game.
