### Overview
The Aegis A3G Vanguard Harbringer is UEE's standard fighter-bomber, converting the standard Warden model's escape pod into a potent bomb bay. The extended range of the Vanguard and the relatively small profile mean that it can go where carrier-based planes or larger strategic bombers don't… and then strike hard and make it back to frontier bases. The Vanguard Harbinger is a powerful bomber that can operate out of the roughest forward operating bases.
The Harbinger is manufactured by Aegis Dynamics, a Human spacecraft manufacturer based on Cestulus. Today, the company is a major manufacturer of both civilian and military crafts. The Vanguard Harbinger has 3 other variants, the fighter variant Warden, the dropship hoplite, and the EMP Warfare Sentinel.
As of today, the Harbinger is not available for sale or upgrade on the pledge store standalone. But when it does it sells for $290, and for a very limited time. And the Harbinger is available for purchase in game for just over 2 Million aUEC. Now that you know a little bit more about the Aegis Vanguard Harbinger let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. The first thing we notice is the very large size 5 hardpoint with a fixed Laser Repeater under the nose. Above that we can see 4 size 2 Proprietary hardpoints found exclusively on the vanguard series, This isn't the stock loadout by the way, if you'd like to know more about mine check out this video. Here we can see the intakes and our retro thrusters glowing. This is my favorite aesthetic feature of the vanguard series. Above these we can see the size 4 proprietary missile rack. And further up we can see the manned turret with 2 size distortion cannons. Moving on beneath the hull we have another size 4 missile rack with 2 size 3 missiles. Just behind this we can see the tracked landing gear exclusive to the vanguard series. Here we can see the vanguards wings are tucked away in landing mode. Around the rear we can see the dual main thrusters. Underneath here is where we have the main and only entrance into the vanguard. The port side is equipped the same as the starboard side.

### Interior
Let's take a look inside. As we close the door we'll turn around to see where the quantum drive is stored. Heading back into the cabin, On the port side we have armor storage. Next to this we have a head that features, a space shitter, a shower, first aid kit, sink and mirror. Next to this we have 2 beds that can be used to log out in. On the Starboard side we have where our torpedos will be stored. There is also a small station here with some server storage underneath. If you know Let me know in the comments what we will be able to do here once this is all fully functional. Next we have amenities like what looks like a space kurig but no nozzeltron. Next to this we have a munitions locker with 4 weapon racks. The turret is located in the middle of the cabin. Inside we can see that the turret doesn't have a great view but its not terrible. The Turret features a 2D radar and 4 MFDs, but no ejection feature. Lets head toward the flight deck. It does have a door to separate the pilot from the rest of the crew. On our way up we can see that there is a hidden compartment labeled Radar. The port side has shield 1, power plant 1, and life support. the starboard side has shield 2 and power plant 2. Getting closer to the cockpit we have our last set of component housings that house our coolers. Alright finally we've made our way to the cockpit, up top we have annunciator panels, below this a 3D radar, and 4 MFDs underneath. The vanguard Harbinger does not yet have an ejection system.


### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, the other vanguard variants, some missile boats, and some bombers. The Google Sheet Document with this data is linked in the description.

* It fits in at 38m in length | Ties in 5th Place.
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | As well as most other ships on this list

* Carries 2500qfu | Ties in 2st with half the ships on this list
* It Cruises by with an SCM speed of 171m/s | Ties 1st place
* It strolls by gingerly with a Max Speed of 1022m/s | Ties 4th place
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 54d/s | Ties in 4th Place
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 54d/s as well | And ties in 4rd again

* And the Aegis Vanguard Harbinger is available for sale in-game for a little over 2,000,000aUEC | And takes the 5th spot

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* It's weapon payload and range with a size 5 and 4 size 2s in unparalleled. Excluding the other vanguards of course.
* The vanguard series has pretty good hull HP. And the harbinger has extra physical and energy resistance over the other variants.
* Having 2500 Quantum Fuel Units is nice. You can equip the fastest size 2 drive and still almost make a trip from PO to Microtech and Back
* Having the weapons center mounted is great because if you loose a wing you don't use fire power.
* And having the cabin space is great for box missions. And the amenities will certainly come in handy in the future.
* Having the turret is great for multi-crew gameplay
* Its missile payload is great as well with 4 size 4 Missile Racks plus 3 size 5 Torpedoes
* And its aUEC price of 2mil is excellent at around 1.4mil less than the warden and hoplite.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* It's MAX Speed is terrible. However this only matters if you plan on running.
* Having bespoke weapons means you don't have as much of a variety of choices
* As well as having them fixed removes the option to be fully gimballed.
* It doesn't currently have an ejection feature
* Another con the Harbinger has over the rest of the vanguards is its acceleration. Now acceleration isn't data found in the game files due to reasons I could spend a who video talking about. So it will never be available on erkul. However it's acceleration can be calculated manually by a user by recording GForces. So special thanks to the citizens over at legacy fleet for their SPAT tool. With SPAT we can see this data from a handful of ships. As you can see by this graph the Harbinger a lot less acceleration than the Sentinel. I own both the sentinel and harbinger, switching from the harb to the Sent, it was night a night and day difference. Acceleration effects all movement. The link to the SPAT tool can be found down below.

### My Thoughts
So what are my thoughts, I have really enjoyed flying the vanguards for the past month. They have definitely become my everyday flyer, very practical, versatile, and they pack a punch. You cant really ask for more in a combat ship. Now all that sounds great, but the harbinger comes with a cherry on top. 3 Size 5 Torpedos. These are great to tip the balance of a fight in your favor from the start. My strategy in either PVE or PVP is to throw one of these missiles and proceed to pounce on the target as soon as the torp leaves the ship. If it misses or gets evaded, no matter they'll have a barrage of firepower coming down on them in no time. This is great to have. Now what you all have come here to find out. What is my choice between the Harb and the Sent... Well.. Honestly I think that's up to you. I personally enjoy dogfighting more than missile play. I also would like to have the versatility to take on quick light fighters in PVP, and with the harbs slower acceleration it makes it that much more of a pain to take out smaller ships. So for me the choice is clear, but I'm not saying the Sentinel is better, It just depends on the pilot. Do you prefer dogfighting with an EMP, or a Tanky Damn Dirty Missile Throwing Ape Machine? I have some really great ideas for reviving the ship battle series so if you'd like to see the Sentinel and Harbinger in a dedicated comparison video make sure your subscribed.
