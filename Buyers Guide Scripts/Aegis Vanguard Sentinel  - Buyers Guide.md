# Aegis Vanguard Sentinel
## A Star Citizen's Buyer's Guide

### Preface
I'm going to tell you everything you need to know before buying the Aegis Vanguard Sentinel and we’re starting right now.

### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we'll be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Aegis Vanguard Sentinel. We'll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats with similar ships, review pros and cons, and I'll give you my thoughts on the Sentinel. If you haven't seen it, my Loadout Guide for the Vanguard Sentinel can be found here, and on the end screen. I go live on Twitch just before every YouTube release come and hang out. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
The Aegis A3G Vanguard Sentinel is an electronic warfare ship that's designed to fight smart instead of taking enemies head on. The conversion features an AR cockpit, an external e-War pod, decoy missiles and a set of EMP charges. Vanguard Sentinels often provide necessary combat support for combined operations. A lone Sentinel assigned wild weasel tasks is frequently paired with Harbinger bombers and Warden escorts for large attack missions.
The Sentinel is manufactured by Aegis Dynamics, a Human spacecraft manufacturer based on Cestulus. Today, the company is a major manufacturer of both civilian and military crafts. The Vanguard Sentinel has 3 other variants, the fighter variant Warden, the dropship hoplite, and the Fighter Bomber harbinger.
As of today, the Sentinel is not available for sale or upgrade on the pledge store standalone. But when it does it sells for $275, and for a very limited time. And the Sentinel is available for purchase in game for just over 2 Million aUEC. Now that you know a little bit more about the Aegis Vanguard Sentinel let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. The first thing we notice is the size 5 hardpoint with a gimballed attrition laser repeater under the nose. Above that we can see the 4 Proprietary distortion repeaters in the nose. Here we can see the intakes and our retro thrusters glowing. This is my favorite aesthetic feature of the vanguard series and on the sentinel I think it works well with the blue and yellow paint. Above these we can see the size 4 propriatary missile rack. And further up we can see the manned turret with 2 size distortion cannons. Moving on beneath the hull we have another size 4 missile rack with 2 size 3 missiles. Just behind this we can see the tracked landing gear exclusive to the vanguard series. Here we can see the vanguards wings are tucked away in landing mode. Around the rear we can see the dual main thrusters. Underneath here is where we have the main and only entrance into the vanguard. The starboard side is identical to the port side.

### Interior
Let's take a look inside. As we close the door we'll turn around to see where the quantum drive is stored. Heading back into the cabin, On the port side we have armor storage. Next to this we have a head that features, a shower, first aid kit, sink and mirror, and last but not least a space shitter that I promise retracts when the ship isn't bugged. Moving on we have a floor to ceiling screen with data on... well spaceship stuff. Next we have some server racks and an opening that I'm pretty sure is supposed to have the same engineering station from the warden. But I think its bugged right now, or they are preparing to add something unique to the sentinel here later. Turning around to the starboard side we have 2 beds that can be used to log out in. Next we have amenities like what looks like a space kurig and of course a nozzeltron for nozzeling. Next to this we have a munitions locker with 4 weapon racks. The turret is located in the middle of the cabin. Inside we can see that the turret doesn't have a great view but its not terrible. The Turret features a 2D radar and 4 MFDs, but no ejection feature. Lets head toward the flight deck. It does have a door to separate the pilot from the rest of the crew. On our way up we can see that there is a hidden compartment labeled Radar with a ghostly looking shield generator in it. The port side has shield 1, power plant 1, and life support. the starboard side has shield 2 and power plant 2. Getting closer to the cockpit we have our last set of component housings that house our coolers. Alright finally we've made our way to the cockpit, up top we have annunciator panels, below this a 3D radar, and 4 MFDs underneath. The vanguard Sentinel does not yet have an ejection system.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, a medium fighter, the other vanguard variants, and some emp warfare ships. The Google Sheet Document with this data is linked in the description.

* The Aegis Vanguard Sentinel weighs in at almost 239,000kg | Ties 8th Place
* It fits in at 38m in length | Ties in last Place with the vanguards and Freelancer.
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | As well as most other ships on this list
* Has a Max Crew Size of 3, if the missing engineering station is a bug | and Ties in 2nd place with the warden and cutlass blue
* Carries 2500qfu | Ties in 1st with the vanguards cutty and freelancer
* It Cruises by with an SCM speed of 171m/s | Ties 6th place
* It strolls by gingerly with a Max Speed of 1022m/s | Ties 7th place
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 54d/s | Ties in 5th Place
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 54d/s as well | And ties in 3rd place this time
* It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 110d/s | Ties in 5th place
* It has a Total Hull HP of 23,500 | Ties 2nd place
* It has a physical armor damage reduction of 2% | Ties in 5th place
* It has an Energy armor damage reduction of 10% | Ties in 3rd place
* It has an EM IR & CS reduction of 0% | The only ships on this list with stealth reductions are the Sabres
* It blasts its way in with a Default Pilot DPS of 3,173 | 1st Place
* It shoots its way though with a Default turret DPS of 1,540 | Takes 1st again. Both its pilot and turret dps should be taken with a grain of salt. These are distortion weapons.
* It has a stock missile payload of over 47,000 | Ties 4th place
* And the Aegis Vanguard Sentinel is available for sale in-game for a little over 2,000,000aUEC | And takes the 9th spot

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* It's weapon payload and range with a size 5 and 4 size 2s in unparalleled. Excluding the other vanguards of course.
* The vanguard series has pretty good hull HP. And they all feature some sort of physical and energy armor reduction.
* Having 2500 Quantum Fuel Units is nice. You can equip the fastest size 2 drive and still almost make a trip from PO to Microtech and Back
* Having the weapons center mounted is great because if you loose a wing you don't use fire power.
* And having the cabin space is great for box missions. And the amenities will certainly come in handy in the future.
* Having the turret is great for multi-crew gameplay
* Its missile payload is great as well with 4 size 4 Missile Racks
* It's EMP is something that certainly sets itself apart from the rest of the vanguard series
* And its aUEC price of 2mil is excellent at around 1.4mil less than the warden and hoplite.
* Another reason for the sentinel over the rest of the vanguards is its agility. Now acceleration isn't data found in the game files due to reasons I don't have time to explain. So it will never be available on erkul. However it's acceleration can be calculated manually by a user by recording its GForces. Again I don't have time to explain why I don't have time to explain. But thanks to the citizens over at legacy fleet we can get this data from a handful of ships. As you can see by this graph the sentinel has much more acceleration than the harbinger. And slightly more than the warden. This cannot be ignored.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* It's MAX Speed is terrible. However this only matters if you plan on running.
* Having bespoke weapons means you don't have as much of a variety of choices
* As well as having them fixed removes the option to be fully gimballed.
* It doesn't currently have an ejection feature

### My Thoughts
So what are my thoughts, I have really enjoyed flying the vanguards for the past few weeks. They are almost perfect combat ships. Nimble for their size, spacious interiors with amenities, devastating fire power, hefty missile payload. What more can you ask for a combat ship? I'll tell you, nothing. There is no reason in the games current state (Unless you cant afford it in game or in real life) to not own a vanguard, if you enjoy combat. Seriously the only way to improve the vanguard would be if they added a mining laser and SCU space to it. And that would be ridiculous. Although 1 SCU would allow someone to store FPS mineables, were not really in the position to complain. But I digress. All this sounds great and I haven't even talked about what makes the sentinel great over the other variants. It has a fucking EMP and guess what boys the EMPs got a buff in the 3.11 PTU. But don't get too excited people are already asking for a nerf. And its the most nimble of the variants. It breaks my heart to say this but, I think Sabre my sabre is going to be collecting some dust in the back of my hangar for a while. The practicality and versatility of the vanguard is just too good to ignore. Now people are going to ask in the comments. What I think is better the harbinger or sentinel... I think I already know the answer however, I will be reserving my judgement for after I review the harb. I may even revive the ship battle series.
