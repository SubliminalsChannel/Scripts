### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we'll be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Aegis Vanguard Hoplite. We'll cover a brief overview, take a tour, compare stats with similar ships, review pros and cons, and I'll give you my thoughts on the Hoplite. If you haven't seen it, my Loadout Guide for the Vanguard Hoplite can be found here, and on the end screen. I go live on Twitch just before every YouTube release come and hang out.

### Overview
The Aegis Vanguard Hoplite is a cross between the winning Vanguard deep space fighter and a dedicated boarding ship. Adapting the reliable design for amphibious operations, the Hoplite is the perfect tool for inserting an armored strike team with enough firepower to get them out again.
The Hoplite is manufactured by Aegis Dynamics, a Human spacecraft manufacturer based on Cestulus. Today, the company is a major manufacturer of both civilian and military crafts. The Vanguard Hoplite has 3 other variants, the e-Warfare Sentinel, the dedicated combat Warden, and the Fighter Bomber harbinger.
As of today, the Hoplite is not available for sale or upgrade on the pledge store standalone. But when it does it sells for $235, and for a very limited time. It is available as a loaner for Redeemer Owners. And the Hoplite is available for purchase in game for over 3.1 Million aUEC. Now that you know a little bit more about the Aegis Vanguard Hoplite let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. The first thing we notice is the large nose gun staring off into space. Behind that we can see the 4 Proprietary ballistic repeaters in the nose. Here we can see the intakes and our retro thrusters glowing. I'm quite fond of this. Way up above this we have a manned turret with 2 size 2 ballistic repeaters. Moving on beneath the hull we have the tracked landing gear exclusive to the vanguard series. Here we can see the vanguards wings are tucked away in landing mode. Around the rear we can see the dual main thrusters, with 2 really large HDMI ports. Underneath here is where we have the main and only entrance into the vanguard. The starboard side is identical to the port side. Oh yeah check out that glow.

### Interior
Let's take a look inside. As we close the door we'll turn around to see where the quantum drive is stored. Heading back into the cabin, the starboard side has a massive weapon rack for 10 weapons and at some point even more supplies. The port side has 2 very comfortable looking drop seats with another rack for 2 more guns, as well as 2 more seats with communication equipment. Back to the Starboard side we have another rack, this one seems to be able to hold larger weapons. Lets head toward the flight deck. It does have a door to separate the pilot for the drop crew. On our way up we can see that there is a hidden compartment labeled Radar with a ghostly looking shield generator in it. The port side has shield 1, power plant 1, and life support. the starboard side has shield 2 and power plant 2. Getting closer to the cockpit we have our last set of component housings that house our coolers. Alright finally we've made our way to the cockpit with our hud in the center, annunciator panels up top, 3D radar, and 4 MFDs below. The vanguard series does not yet have an ejection system and the hoplite may never have one. If your typing a comment about how I missed the turret HALT. The turret is located in the middle of the cabin. Inside we can se that the turret doesnt have a great view but its not terrible. The Turret features a 2D radar and 4 MFDs, but not ejection feature.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, Some Dropships, the other vanguard variants, and some multi-crew ships. The Google Sheet Document with this data is linked in the description.

* The Aegis Vanguard Hoplite weighs in at almost 230,000kg | 7th Place
* It fits in at 38m in length | Ties in last Place with the vanguards, Freelancer, and Valkyrie.
* Totes 0scu of Cargo | As well as most other ships on this list
* Has a Max Crew Size of 2 | and Ties in last place with most ships again
* Carries 2500qfu | As well as every other ship on this list except the hurricane.
* It Crawls by with an SCM speed of 171m/s | Ties in 4th with the sentinel and harbinger
* It strolls by gingerly with a Max Speed of 1022m/s | Ties in 7th with them again
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 54d/s | Ties in 3rd Place
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 54d/s as well | And takes 2nd place this time
* It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 110d/s | Ties in 3rd place
* It has a Total Hull HP of 32,000 | And takes 1st place
* It has a physical armor damage reduction of 2% | Ties in 6th place
* It has an Energy armor damage reduction of 10% | Ties in 2nd with the cutty hurricane and vanguards
* It has an EM IR & CS reduction of 0% | The only ship on this list with stealth reductions is the Prowler
* It blasts its way in with a Default Pilot DPS of 1,852 | 4th Place
* It shoots its way though with a Default turret DPS of 598 | And ties in 5th Place with the MIS.
* It has a stock missile payload of over 30,000 | Takes 6th place
* And the Aegis Vanguard Hoplite is available for sale in-game for a little under 3,100,000aUEC | And takes the 8th spot

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* It's weapon payload with a size 5 and 4 size 2s in unparalleled. Well excluding the other vanguards.
* The extra boos off Hull HP over the rest of the vanguard series is great.
* Its great for multi crew combat with its manned Turret
* And its 6 Drop seats and weapon racks
* The weapon range of having a size 5 weapon on the nose is around 5,000m. That's a huge advantage. You can take our some enemies before they get into range to do any damage.
* It's armor has come physical and a decent amount of Energy reduction
* Having 2500 Quantum Fuel Units is nice. You can equip the fastest size 2 drive and still almost make a trip from PO to Microtech and Back
* Having the weapons center mounted is great because if you loose a wing you don't use fire power.
* And having the cabin space is great for box missions.


###### For cons, I'd say...
* It's Max Speed is terrible
* Having bespoke weapons means you don't have as much of a variety of choices
* As well as having them fixed removes the option to be fully gimballed.
* It doesn't currently have an ejection feature
* Compared to other drop ships it doesn't have very many seats. For example the cutlass black can hold just as many ground troops in its cargo hold.
* It's a drop ship that has no weapon placements to support troops, like the Valkyrie can.
* It has only 1 egress point this will make the drop troops exit predictable
* And finally its price in game at 3.1 million aUEC is outrageous

### My Thoughts
So what are my thoughts, In a vacuum the hoplite is a brawler that brings a ton of firepower to the fight. Its practical, and ticks almost every box except cargo and mining. It's a great versatile ship that I enjoyed flying and testing for this review. However this isn't a vacuum... Well it is if your out in space but... Anyway, Aside from being terrible at its primary function, what makes the hoplite not something I want to fly doesn't have much to do with what the hoplite can or cant do. It's what its siblings can do and their price. I touched on this briefly but, you can purchase the hoplite in game for 3.1 million aUEC. Not saying this is a bad price, but, I can purchase a Harbinger or Sentinel for around 2 million aUEC. Two ships that excel at combat due to having either an EMP or Torpedo's all on top of what makes the hoplite great. The fact is "In my opinion" in the games current state the hoplite is one of the worst drop ships. The cutlass red is the best "Change my mind" or you can get a Valkyrie or prowler that would excel at protecting ground troops via the multiple egress points or weapons that have a great view of the ground beneath in multiple directions. Heck even a cutlass black can serve the purpose of getting ground troops to the objective safely at a fraction of the price.
