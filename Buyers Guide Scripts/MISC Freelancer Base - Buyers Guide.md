Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and today we will be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the MISC Freelancer . And we’ll compare those features amongst competing ships, so you can make an informed buying decision. Well actually for no you have it for free!

### Overview
The Freelancer is a multi-role transport spacecraft developed by MISC and was the first vessel to be constructed as part of a unique lend-lease agreement with the Xi'an government. Initially marketed as an efficient long-haul merchant ship for private enterprises, the Freelancer quickly became the ship of choice for dedicated explorers.
Musashi Industrial and Starflight Concern (MISC) is a spacecraft manufacturer headquartered in Fujin City on Saisei (Centauri III). Founded in 2805 after a merger between Hato Electronics Corporation and the Musashi Lifestyle Design Unit spinoff of Acorn Limited, MISC primarily produces transport and industrial utility spacecraft, such as the Freelancer and the Starfarer, but has also been expanding into the racing market with the Razor.
The ship's hull is sold in several variants that have been adapted for various alternate roles like the Freelancer DUR exploration ship, the Freelancer MAX enhanced cargo ship, and the Freelancer MIS carrier-based missile boat.
As of today, the Freelancer is available for sale and upgrade on the pledge store for $110, and is available in the Freelancer game package for $125.
It is currently available as a temporary loaner for everyone due to a few bugs, It is also available to Hull A& B, Mercury Star Runner, And Vulcan Owners Owner's.
And The Freelancer is available for sale at Lorville's New Deal for almost 1.7mil aUEC. And it is available for rent at Area 18 and Lorville's rental stations. Now that you know a little bit more about the MISC Freelancer let's take a tour.

### Exterior
If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. The paint your seeing is the stock paint or I guess in this case lack of paint. Storm Surge and black are also available. Although I actually have the black equipped right now but am currently experiencing a bug. Let me know in the comments if you are too. Up front we have the Daft Punk helmet style look for the freelancers nose. This is a thruster you'll see these around. Above the landing gear we have the side entrance. Her we have the huge proprietary Dual size 3 turret found on the freelancer series. This one is equipped with 2 size three ballistic cannons. Up here on the main engines we have what looks like a speaker diaphragm but I think its a retro thruster. Moving toward the rear. Under each wing we have a size 4 missile rack and a size 3 missile rack, each holding 2 missiles. Around the rear we have its dual main thrusters. In concept the these actually rotated down to be used as VTOL thrusters like the cutlass black but I think they nixed that idea. Oh almost forgot up here is the rear manned turret. Also around the rear we have the entrance to the cargo hold. The starboard side is identical to the port side. I was going to give you one last look but this happened and I couldn't leave it out.

### Interior
Let's head inside. Through the cargo bay doors we first have the rear manned turret. This turret has 4 MFDs and a 2 D radar. I'm not a fan of its view. Heading back down, on the Starboard side we have Radar 1, Shield 1, Avionics 1, Radar 2, Power 1. On the Port Side we have the Quantum Drive, both coolers, Avionics 2, Shield 2, and life support. This cargo hold is big enough to fit 54 of the 66SCU. A Tumbril Cyclone will also fit but its a tight fit anything smaller will fit with ease. Continuing on we have another room that holds the remaining 12scu of cargo and the docking collar. Next we have the living quarters. On the port side we have what looks like a food processor and beverage maker. Next is the airlock and side entrance we saw earlier. Turning around on the starboard side we have a non functional workstation. To our right we have a head. It has a shower, sink, and a space shitter but I haven't been able to extend it. Heading toward the flight deck we have 4 beds. Fun fact these also are the freelancers escape pods. Entering into the flight deck we have 4 seats. In the rear on the port and starboard side we have engineering stations that each have 1 functional MFD. Lets skip to the co-pilot seat. The co-pilot seat has a couple of terribly placed MFDs unless you have head tracking and a few well placed ones. Let's check out the pilot seat. The pilot seat has a pretty similar setup except the middle MFD is replaced by the HUD and Radar. The freelancer series does not have the new UI yet. There are no ejection seats in the flight deck.

### Comparison
Now that we’ve taken a tour, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, all of the freelancer variants, Some Competitors and some starter cargo ships. The Google Sheet Document with the data is linked in the description.

* The MISC Freelancer weighs in at almost 210,000kg | 5th Place
* It fits in at 38m in length | Ties in 6th Place with the rest of the freelancers
* Totes 66scu of Cargo | 3rd Place
* Has a Max Crew Size of 5 | Ties in 1st place with the freelancers and andromeda.
* Carries 2500qfu | Ties in 3rd place
* It cruises by with an SCM speed of 154m/s | Ties in 6th place Place
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1,005m/s | Ties in 6th place Place again
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 47d/s | Ties in 6th place Place again
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 47d/s as well | Ties in 5th place Place
* And It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 74d/s | Ties in 6th place Place
* It has a Total Hull HP of just over 19,000 | 4th Place
* It blasts its way in with a Default Pilot DPS of 1,568 | 4th place
* It shoots through the enemy with a Turret DPS of 916 | Ties in 3rd place
* It has a decent combined missile payload of almost 32,000 | 6th Place
* And the MISC Freelancer is available for sale in-game for almost 1,700,000aUEC | And takes the 6th spot.

It's important to take notice that compared to the starter cargo ships the freelancer is pretty slow. however if we were to compare it to ships of its size you'd see that its actually pretty nimble.

### Pros vs Cons
Alright let's weigh some of the pros and cons
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* 66scu of cargo space is great for an intermediate trader. Perfect for maximizing illegal vice trade runs.
* It has plenty of room for players.
* It has a very large quantum fuel tank that if paired with the fastest size 2 drive can still make a trip from one end of stanton to the other without needing to refuel.
* It has a decent amount of Hull HP
* Having 4 always gimballed size 3 hardpoints is alot of firepower!
* It's missile payload compared to light cargo ships is great.
* Now for some things we cant see on paper. It has room for some passengers, mission boxes, SCU, and land all at the same time.
* I'm running out of room here and I'm not going to edit this template.
* It has amenities like a beds to log out in, a toilet, shower, sink, food processor. Its purpose built for long range.
* It has a Manned turret, great for experiencing, multi-crew gameplay
* when degradation come in having all the components in one location makes for easy repairs
* and if your considering this over a cutty black the freelancer has 2 shield generators where the cutlass has 1.

###### For cons, I'd say...
* Its SCM speed and Max speed are pretty slow
* It can be pretty hard to stop.
* Its view from the turret could be better it has a blind spot on top and straight ahead
* And a common complaint is that the view from the cockpit is not very good.

### My Thoughts
What are my thoughts? I think the Freelancer is the best medium sized multi-role ship we have. It Excels at everything, PVE Combat, medium cargo hauling, multi-crew gameplay, long distance journeys, and taking land vehicles planet side. It's only con is its speed. And considering its is star citizens equivalence of a semi truck this is to be expected. What I really like about the freelancer is its ability to excel at almost everything you can do in star citizen except mining. If you are a new or intermediate player you should be using this as your main ship. If your looking to upgrade to this over the cutlass. The choice isn't that simple. Both ships are great, when it comes down to it, do you want the nimbleness of the cutlass, or the tankyness of the freelancer. Either way you cant make a bad choice. Well the FREElancer is Free right now so there's no need to buy one at the moment. If I had to guess after 3.10 goes stable we will see this loaner fade. If you watching this after that. I prefer the Freelancer over the Cutlass But that's my opinion.
