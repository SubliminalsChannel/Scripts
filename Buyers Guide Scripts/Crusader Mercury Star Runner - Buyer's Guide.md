### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Buyer’s Guide" this is SubliminaL here and today we'll be discussing the features, functions, and benefits of the Crusader Mercury Star Runner. We'll cover a brief overview, Show off some Skin, compare stats with similar ships, review pros and cons, and I'll give you my thoughts on the Star Runner.

### Overview
The Mercury Star Runner is a courier spacecraft designed by Crusader Industries. Used by the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) in blockade running operations, the Mercury is a fast, armored runner ship capable of transporting small quantities of valuable goods or storing encrypted information in onboard computers. The Belligerent Duck, a Mercury Star Runner operated by criminals, famously escaped the Terra system to Banu space despite a significant amount of pursuers in 2948.
Crusader Industries is a Human spacecraft and spacecraft component manufacturer. One of four corporations in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) to own a planet, Crusader Industries designs and constructs its spacecraft in the upper atmosphere of Crusader (Stanton II), while the corporation and its employee-inhabitants reside on a latticework of floating colony platforms.
As of today, the Star Runner is  available for sale and upgrade on the pledge store for $225 Warbond and $260 Standalone. Its available in the Ground Air Enterprise Pack for $295 Warbond & $330 Standalone. This pack comes with the tumbril cyclone and The Ranger CV. It's also available in the Frontier Choppers Pack for $625 Warbond and $695 Standalone. This pack includes a warlock, argo srv, bucc, and vulture. In my opinion none of these packs are worth the money unless you plan on using some of the other ships as LTI tokens. The MSR is a loaner for the Genesis Starliner, and All of the Starlifters. Upgrading your cat to the C2 gets my recommendation. You'll have a cat and an MSR until the C2 comes out. The C2 will have over 600 SCU. The Star Runner has 3 alternative paint skins available, The Polar Paint Skin, the Skyrider paint Skin, and one that we don't speak about here on Subliminal's channel because I can't have one because I wasn't around to play some stupid game back in 2018.

[comment]: # (### Exterior If you'd like to skip this tour the time stamp is on screen and in the description. The first thing we notice is the very large size 5 hardpoint with a fixed Laser Repeater under the nose. Above that we can see 4 size 2 Proprietary hardpoints found exclusively on the Star Runner series, This isn't the stock loadout by the way, if you'd like to know more about mine check out this video. Here we can see the intakes and our retro thrusters glowing. This is my favorite aesthetic feature of the Star Runner series. Above these we can see the size 4 proprietary missile rack. And further up we can see the manned turret with 2 size distortion cannons. Moving on beneath the hull we have another size 4 missile rack with 2 size 3 missiles. Just behind this we can see the tracked landing gear exclusive to the Star Runner series. Here we can see the Star Runners wings are tucked away in landing mode. Around the rear we can see the dual main thrusters. Underneath here is where we have the main and only entrance into the Star Runner. The port side is equipped the same as the starboard side. ### Interior Let's take a look inside. As we close the door we'll turn around to see where the quantum drive is stored. Heading back into the cabin, On the port side we have armor storage. Next to this we have a head that features, a space shitter, a shower, first aid kit, sink and mirror. Next to this we have 2 beds that can be used to log out in. On the Starboard side we have where our torpedos will be stored. There is also a small station here with some server storage underneath. If you know Let me know in the comments what we will be able to do here once this is all fully functional. Next we have amenities like what looks like a space kurig but no nozzeltron. Next to this we have a munitions locker with 4 weapon racks. The turret is located in the middle of the cabin. Inside we can see that the turret doesn't have a great view but its not terrible. The Turret features a 2D radar and 4 MFDs, but no ejection feature. Lets head toward the flight deck. It does have a door to separate the pilot from the rest of the crew. On our way up we can see that there is a hidden compartment labeled Radar. The port side has shield 1, power plant 1, and life support. the starboard side has shield 2 and power plant 2. Getting closer to the cockpit we have our last set of component housings that house our coolers. Alright finally we've made our way to the cockpit, up top we have annunciator panels, below this a 3D radar, and 4 MFDs underneath. The Mercury Star Runner does not yet have an ejection system.)


### Comparison
Now that we know a little bit more about the Mercury Star Runner, let's see how it compares to other ships you might be considering. For comparison, I have selected 10 ships, mostly multicrew ships, the MAX, Herald, & and a starter. The Google Sheet Document with this data is linked in the description.

* The Crusader Mercury Star Runner weighs in at  over 1,600,000kg | 9th Place
* It fits in at 56m in length | 7th Place
* Totes 114scu of Cargo | 3rd Place
* Has a Max Crew Size of 5 | Ties in 3rd place
* It Carries 9,740qfu | 2nd Place, This is a crazy amount of QT Fuel
* It Cruises by with an SCM speed of 215m/s | 1st place
* It blazes by with a Max Speed of 1287m/s | 2nd only the only other data runner, and with it being such a large tanky ship this means whatever can catch up to it probably wont be able to take it down.
* It has a Maximum Pitch Rate of 50d/s | Ties in 3rd Place
* It has a Maximum Yaw Rate of 50d/s as well | 3rd Place
* It has a Maximum Roll Rate of 125d/s | Ties in 1st Place
* It has a Total Hull HP of 59,400 | Takes 2nd place, considering the carrack is twice the length this is insane.
* It has a physical armor damage reduction of 0% | 8th Place
* It has an Energy armor damage reduction of 0% | 8th place
* It has an EM IR & CS reduction of 0% | No ships on this list have stealth reductions
* It shoots peas with a Default Pilot DPS of 880 | 7th Place
* It Blasts its way in with a Default turret DPS of 1,760 | 4th Place
* It has a stock missile payload of over 22,000 | 7th place
* And the Mercury Star Runner is the only ship not available for sale in-game

### Pros vs Cons
Alright before we weigh some of the pros and cons, just know that my template here only has 10 slots and its a bitch to change it so I'll speak all of my pros but only show the top 10.
###### I would say its pros are, as far as metrics are concerned...
* Its fast as fuck. In both SCM and especially its Max speed.
* It's Multi-Crew gameplay is great now with 2 turrets and will be even better when someone can work the scanner.
* The damage potential with all the guns manned is excellent.
* Its cargo space is excellent as well at 114 SCU. Of course there are ships with larger capacity but imagine being able to pick up and sell data simultaneously with cargo in the future.
* Having almost 10k Quantum Fuel Units is outmatched pound for pound. The fastest most inefficient drive can make a trip from PO to Microtech 7 Times. Wish I could replace some of that for Hydrogen fuel.
* The Hidden underbelly is great I cant wait for when its possible to be disabled and boarded by enemies. They'll be playing whack-a-mole for hours!
* The hidden cargo is great to have if you sell vice.
* It's Acceleration is great lets just compare this to a few competitors. Here it is vs the Connie, this is how it stacks up to the cutty, and finally just for shits and giggles here it is against the sabre. Ill just leave that up for a few min while I continue with the other half of these cons.
* Its atmospheric flight is great for its Size
* It's agility is excellent as well for its size
* It's HULL HP is out of this world
* Storage space is superb. Make sure you watch my "Make it Fit" video
* Having redundant components for now means you can run a full stealth build at no cost to performance.
* The cabin space is very spacious. Plenty of room for crew and amenities to keep them comfortable.
* Although the pilot DPS isnt great having them gimballed helps alot. I love adding cannons that I would normally not dream of putting on a ship this size.
* And finally most importantly its beautiful

###### For cons, I'd say...
* It's pilot DPS could be better. But its understandable that every ship cant be a solo combat ship.
* It only has one entry exit point. Id love to see another entrance near the long hallway to the bridge.
* Umm, hmmm, I'm going to have to start knit picking here. It doesn't have an ejection system.
* I feel like such a high-tech ship should have come with remote turrets.
* Also after some testing, it looks like placing handheld illegal cargo or players with crimestat in the hidden cargo area does not prevent you from getting scanned by or attacked by the UEE.
* And there is something else but I cant seem to remember it right now. I'll let you know if I remember it.

### My Thoughts
So what are my thoughts, come on you know I love this thing. I have never been able to come up with so many pros for a single ship before.  It does have some cons but a lot of them are no big deal... Oh that's right that final con is that its hydrogen fuel consumption requires you to have to fucking refuel after every box mission. And you'll probably have to spend more money on fuel than you'll make completing the mission. This is very annoying but I have heard rumors that the 3.12 evocati have seen a fix for this although at this time I'm not sure if it is slightly better or drastically better. Regardless I am a proud owner of this beautiful ship and it has become my everyday driver for now. And if they fix to the hydrogen fuel happens it will just sweeten the pot. I even have a second one for my C2 Loaner so I don't have to wait for the claim times. I've talked about the MSR enough. If you are looking for a great all-around excellent multicrew ship the MSR gets my endorsement.
