# Aopoa Khartu-Al
## Loadout Guide

### Preface
I'm going to give you my recommendations on how to loadout your Aopoa Khartu-Al, and we're starting right now.

### Introduction
Special thanks for all of the support from Patrons and Channel Members, it takes a while to make one of these and your support is appreciated. Welcome to "A Star Citizenâ€™s Loadout Guide" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and In this guide we will discuss my recommendations for both weapons and components for your Aopoa Khartu-Al. The best use of the Khartu-Al in the games current state is a PVE Combat Ship. And today, were going to load it out to Excel at just that. My full review of the Khartu-Al will be coming soon so make sure your subscribed and have the bell clicked. I'm live right now! Head over to twitch to hang out and give me your thoughts on the Khartu-Al and my loadout. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
The Aopoa Khartu-al is an export model of a Xi'an military light fighter, for sale to human civilians as a dedicated scout/explorer. It recently received a couple of buffs, an upgrade from size 3 to size 4 hardpoints and the viability of fixed weapons, so it is certainly worth a look. The Kharthu-Al is a stealth ship, although I will not be building this primary loadout for stealth, I will give you my recommendations if you'd like to give stealth a shot at the end of this video.

### Components
Alright lets take a look at its components. Let's Start with the Power Plant, the component that gives all of the other components power. The standard power plant on the Khartu-Al is the size 1, grade 2, Military Class, DynaFlux, with almost 3,500 max power draw per second and a 11sec draw request time. This is actually a pretty decent power plant. I don't recommend upgrading it unless aUEC is no option. But if your interested in a slightly better power plant I would add the trusty JS-300. Its grade 1,  Military Class, has almost 3,700 max power generation/sec and a 10s draw request time. This will add about 200 max power draw and reduce the time it takes to reach that max power draw down to .7 seconds. To find out why upgrading this has no purpose other than shaving .7 seconds off your EMP recover time check out my power plant guide. The JS-300 will set you back around 20,000 aUEC, and can be found at these locations.

Let's discuss its coolers, these are used to cool our components. The standard coolers on the Khartu-Al are the size 1, grade 2, Military Class, Polar Coolers with a max cooling rate of 280kilos/sec, and a draw request time of 12.5 seconds. These coolers have more than enough cooling capacity but have a long request time. You can certainly keep these if you are low on aUEC, they are good enough. If you want to upgrade them anyway I recommend adding Zero Rush's, they are Grade 2, Competition Class, with a cooling rate of 230kilos/sec, and a draw request time of 3 seconds, these offer less capacity but can get to that full capacity in just 3 seconds. Again to find out why upgrading this is solely for EMP recovery, or for an explanation on how kilo per second isn't a unit of measurement, checkout this guide on coolers. One Zero Rush will set you back over 16,000 aUEC, and can be found at these locations.

Before we get to the shields. Make sure you check out the link to this specific loadout at Erkul.Games, there is a link in the description. It even tells you the prices and locations of where to find these items in the verse. Remember to head over to the Channel Discord to see my updated loadouts. We have a community of over 1,300 citizens who like to discuss ships, loadouts, components, weapons, and more. Click the link in the Description.

Now for its shield generator that protects our ship and these components. The Khartu-Al's stock shield generators are the Size 1, grade 2, Military Class, ForceWall Shield Generators with an HP pool of 5,800, a 288hp/s regen rate, blocks a minimum of 50% of ballistic fire, has a 4.55s dmg delay, a 6.5s dwn delay, and a 12.6s draw request time. ForceWalls are actually pretty good, but the FR-66s slightly outperform them in every way. An FR-66 is grade 1 Military Class, with an HP pool of over 6,000, a 306hp/s regen rate, blocks a minimum of 50% of ballistic fire, has a 3.85s dmg delay, a 5.5s dwn delay, and an 10s draw request time. This will give you more shield pool, and provide a much quicker regen rate. A slight win-win over the stock loadout. The shields in Star Citizen have alot of depth. I'd pair the FR-66 with a Guardian for PVP or if You want faster regen pair it with a Mirage, just be prepared to use the Khartu-Al's speed to your advantage if you get overwhelmed and need to flee. One FR-66 will set you back over 18,000 aUEC and can be found at these locations.

[comment]: # (It should be noted that there is a better shield combo in my opinion. If you own either a Banu Defender or Esperia Prowler pairing one FR-76 with a Sukoran from those ships is great. The Sukoran has 100% Ballistic Resistance so it will need to be taken completely down before you can take hull damage. Unfortunately if you don't own either of these ships there is no way to get access to the Sukoran.)

And lastly the Quantum Drive that will help you get to the stores that sell these components faster. The standard QT drive on the Khartu-Al is the size 1, grade 3, Civilian Class, Eos, with a 138Mm/s quantum speed, an 9.1/Mm fuel requirement, a 5s spool up, and a 9.4s cooldown time. This drive have great range but is terribly slow. I recommend using the Atlas. The Atlas is Grade 1, Civilian Class, has a 152Mm per second quantum speed, a 7.5/Mm fuel requirement, a 5.1sec second Spool Up and a 8.7sec cooldown time. This drive is one of the fastest drives that can make a trip from one end of the System to the other. The Atlas will run you almost 18,000aUEC can be found at these locations.

[comment]: # (In the games current state, I only need to be able to make a trip from PO to MicroTech without needing to refuel.)

### Weapons
Now let's talk about its stock weapons and my recommendations. The Khartu-Al is equipped with 2 Gimballed size 4 weapon hardpoints on each side. Each gimbal has a Size 3 CF-337 Panther Laser Repeater. One panther does 96 alpha damage, times 275rpm, for a total of 440dps, and a 2,100-meter range. These weapons are one of my favorites for PVE. But since fixed weapons are extremely viable for such a nimble ship, lets step this up a notch and add their big brothers the CF-447 Rhino Laser Repeaters. One Rhino does 159 alpha damage, times 250rpm, for a total of 660dps, and a freaking 4,000-meter range. One Rhino will run you over 22,000aUEC each and can be found at these locations.

[comment]: # (Tucked inside the fuselage we have a MSD-322 Missile Rack with 2 Dominator IIs. One Dominator Is size 2, Electro Magnetic, does 3,900 damage, has a 1.7s lock time, and a 6,000m lock range. On the other side we have another MSD 322 with 2 Ignite II's, One Ignite II is size 2, Infrared, does 3,700 damage, has a 1.5s lock time, and a 5,700m lock range. These are great for striking from a long range. I usually prefer crosssection but if were going to be this close to a ship with backup lets go for a quick lock time and temporary blindness for the target. I'll add a few Rattler IIs. One Rattler is Size 2, does 3,500 damage, has a 1.26s lock time, and a 4,500m lock range. An honerable mention would be StrikeFore II's because of their range and damage. One Rattler II will cost you 35aUEC each and can be found at these locations.)

### Stealth

Lets talk about stealth. Going stealth in the Khartu-Al is well what this ship is designed for in lore. Picking Components is pretty easy. I'll strap on the Stealth Grade Slipstream Power Plant, Drop in a couple of Stealth Grade 1 Mirage Shield generators (Be careful with these, you will need to use the Khartu-Al's speed to flee if you get into trouble, but you'll have a quick recovery time), Throw in some zero rushes, not going stealth here instead focusing on EMP recover time, And lastly id use the Atlas QT drive, You could use the Spectre stealth drive but you'll loose significant range. That was all pretty straight forward. Now for the weapons. I decided on the Revenant Ballistic Gatlings. Now these are great for a few reasons, they have great range, excellent DPS, and low stealth emissions. But at the cost of having a low ammo count. But I think this is a worthy price to pay considering you'll be using this build to hunt players, and can easily become accustom to quick bursts of surprise damage. Take out your target repair rearm and repeat. I can hear the complaints now but subliminal stealth isn't a thing. Lets just take a look at some stats. Your resting IR in the Khartu-Al is between 4,300 to 5,000 with this build. So depending on your oppositions radar, your detection range is between 2250 and 3375 if your just sitting. And guess what you are free to fly around at any speed while firing without raising your IR as long as you don't use after burner. With the revenants range of 3,700 you can make a first strike on any opponent without being seen, giving you a huge advantage. This is one of the few ships in star citizen that can benefit from stealth as long as you stick to a specific strategy and understand your weaknesses.

### Debriefing
These are just that my recommendations, and are not the best for every situation. If you agree or disagree let me know in the comments. If you don't have about 150,000 aUEC to spend on all this at once I would buy them in the following order. The most important thing here are the weapons, as I think most players can benefit for fixed with this ship, and more damage is great. Followed by the shields. And honestly after that there is no necessity to upgrade unless you want the absolute best.
