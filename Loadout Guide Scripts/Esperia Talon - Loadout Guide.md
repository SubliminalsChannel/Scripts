## Loadout Guide

### Preface
I'm going to give you my recommendations on how to loadout your Esperia Talon, and we're starting right now.

### Introduction
Thank you so much for all of the support from Patrons, Channel Members, and Twitch Subscribers that make this possible. Welcome to "A Star Citizen’s Loadout Guide" What's up Citizens, this is SubliminaL here and In this guide we will discuss my recommendations for both weapons and components for your Esperia Talon, our primary build will be a mostly stealthy PVE or PVP fighter. My loadout guide for the talon shrike and buyers guides for dach of them will be coming soon so make sure your subscribed and have the bell clicked. Enough with the formalities, let's get to it.

### Overview
The Esperia Talon is a small and light single-seat fighter designed for escort services and targeted strikes. A pair of Size 4 weapons and 2 size 3 missile racks complement the Talon's "strike first and strike hard" combat style. Today were going to load it out to do just that, strike first & strike hard. I'll also briefly cover a fully stealth build and compare the signatures as well.

### Components
Now that we understand the objective of this build, Lets take a look at its components. Let's Start with the Power Plant, that generates power for our weapons and components. The standard power plant on the Talon is the size 1, grade C, Stealth Class, SonicLite, this plant does not even have enough power to support the stock build. When deciding on a power plant your priorities should be stealth or request time, with max power generation being last. So ill be adding a SlipStream. It's grade A, Stealth Class, hase almost 1,800 max power generation/sec and a super quick 1.25s draw request time. We'll will gain just enough power for the rest of this build, and reduce the time it takes to reach that max power draw down to just 1.25 seconds.

Let's discuss its coolers, these cool your weapons and components after they've overheated. The standard coolers on the Talon are the size 1, grade B, Civilian Class, FlashFreeze Coolers. I can't stress this enough you DO NOT NEED to upgrade these. However I want to lower my emissions as much as possible, for I recommend adding Snowblinds, but... this wont be enough for weapons I'm going to be using so I'll pair them with a zero rush. By upgrading these you are slightly raising our IR signature but at least it can handle the rest of the build.

For a full explanation of how Power Plants and Coolers work, or for an explanation of what I mean when I say Kilo?Second, checkout my guides on power plants and coolers. Shields are QT Drives coming soon.

Now for its shield generator that protects our ship and these components. The Talon's stock shield generators are the size 1, grade C, Military Class, Sukoran Shield Generators. That's right ladies and gentleman, we have size 1 sukorans now. I do hope they change the name though. If you dont know already these are the size  1 versions of the popular size 2 shield made my the tavarins. What makes them special is that they are 100% resistant to ballistic fire. Anyway I want to go for a stealth build that wont leave me completely defenseless, so ill be pairing one of the sukorans with a stealth class mirage, a mirage is, grade 1, Stealth Class, with an HP pool of over 3,000, a 342hp/s regen rate, blocks a minimum of 50% of ballistic fire, has a 2.14s dmg delay, a 14s dwn delay, and a 3s request time. This will actually lower our overall shield pool, however the Mirages quick regen will allow us to get enough health back quickly to get back into the fight. I was able to run this build with 2 mirages against HRT targets and only perished to asteroids. So combined with a sukoran I'm as tanky as I need to be but also stealthy at the same time. An honorable mention would be to pair the mirage with a guardian or a FR-66 if you don't anticipate ballistic fire.

[comment]: <> (It should be noted that there is another great shield combo in my opinion. Pairing one Umbra or FR-76 with a Sukoran is great. The Sukoran has 100% Ballistic Resistance so it will need to be taken down completely for ballistics to damage the hull from that shield generator or completely if you are fortunate enough to have 2. The upside is unparalleled shield pool and pretty good Stealth, the downside is a terrible regen rate. However you can adapt your playstyle, you will just need to ensure you take your enemy out before your shields go down completely because if they do, it will take a long time for them to regen, for this reason I don't recommend dual Sukorans if you plan to PVP. Unfortunately if you don't own either the Banu Defender or Prowler, there is no way to get access to the Sukoran.)

And lastly the Quantum Drive that will help you get to the stores that sell these components faster. The standard QT drive on the Talon is the size 1, grade C, Stealth Class, Drift. This drive is pretty quick but it doesn't have enough range to make a trip across the system. As with every ship with 583 quantum fuel units I recommend adding an Atlas. The Atlas is Grade A, Civilian Class, has a 152Mm/s quantum speed, a 7.5/Mm fuel requirement, a 5.1sec second Spool Up and a 9sec cooldown time. The Atlas is one of the fastest size 1 drive that can make a trip across the system.

Almost every component I recommend can be found at New Babbage, with the atlas being the exception, you'll have to go to PO for that. Before we get to the weapons, we need talk about my loadout guides, recently due to changes in meta my video guides go obsolete as soon as days after release. My solution to the problem is SubliminalsChannel.tv. Over on the loadouts page is where you can find my most up-to-date loadouts and the date they were last modified. The loadout page itself includes the video guide, links to the #DPSCalculator loadout, the channel discord for further discussion, the build itself with context, and honorable mentions. There are only a few builds here now, new builds will be available after the release of the video guides, and older builds will be trickling in periodically.

### Weapons
Now let's talk about its stock weapons and my recommendations. Underneath the Talon is equipped with two size 4 hardpoints. Holding a pair of gimballed Stealth LightStrike III Laser Canons. One LightStrike III does 240 alpha damage, times 84rpm, for a total of 336dps, and a 2,400-meter range. With the Talons agility we need to go fixed for sure. Through my testing I have found 2 favorite weapons with 2 different attack styles. If you want to use the talons speed and agility to your advantage to get in close and outstrafe your opponents go for Attrition-4's. Lets talk about these for a second, Attritions do a tone of damage within a 500m range. But outside of that range they are terrible, due to their damage drop-off. But as you'll notice most of your engagements are within this range. You need to overclock these and with proper trigger discipline you can do some hefty damage. An honorable mention for energy repeaters would be CF-447s.
Another weapon set I had alot of fun with is the C-788 Combines. What makes the combines speacial is their splash damage. Projectiles hit the target and shortly after explode hitting multiple shield facings and parts of the hull. It's like flying around wielding dual sniper rifles. They have great DPS, Range, and most importantly stealth. And those three things combined with a stealth build is great. The strategy here is to creep up on an unsuspecting target and staying at range as long as possible.

Underneath the Talon we have 2 MSD-322 Missile racks. Each holding 2 Tempest II's. Look I'm gonna be honest guys I'm not sure what the missile meta is at the moment things keep changing and countermeasures are probably overpowered. I've been using my usual Rattler II's these are cluster missiles with a flashbang effect. Pretty cool. The values you are seeing on screen are not a bug with the DPS DPSCalculator. But keep yourself seated. They don't appear to do that much more damage over other missiles. Remember these are the only cluster missiles in the game. We have nothing to compare it to. My guess is this is the value the devs needed to put in to get the rats to do the intended damage to a ship don't read into it too much its just game code we're in the middle of a missile rework. I'm choosing these because they seem to outperform other missiles in every other category.

If you don't have a whopping 145,000 aUEC to buy this entire build all at once I would buy them in the following order. The most important things here are the weapons but both the coolers and powerplant will need to be upgraded to not have issues.

### Stealth
Lets talk about a complete stealth build. This would be great for sneaking up on PVP bounties, here's how id load it out. I'll keep the Snowblind power plant from the main build, add 2 snowblinds instead of just 1, add 2 Stealth grade 1 mirage Shield Generators, And you can pick whatever QT drive you prefer. Now for the weapons those C-788 Combines are perfect for this. An honorable mention would be the LightStrike 4 Laser canons to be as stealthy as possible. At the cost of dps and range.

Lets take a look at its stealth signature with this build equipped with light strikes. Our IR signature after the talon finishes powering up is around 5,800. So depending on your oppositions radar, your detection range is between 2,000 and 3,000m if your not using afterburner and firing your weapons. Firing your weapons seems to add about 2,000 more IR and using afterburner or spacebrake completely negates stealth. Now just for reference lets check out my recommended build with attritions. This IR signature after the talon finishes powering up is around 6,700. So this is about a 300 - 500 meter difference between the 2. And if I remove the attritions for C788s it this will narrow the gap even further. So for this reason I will just stick to my semi stealth build as I don't want to be left completely vulnerable with 2 mirages.
